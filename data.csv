0,"A simple game of hide-and-seek leads the children into the adventure of their lives.
An exciting story that will have little readers turning the pages, eager to know what comes next.
James, his sister Sally, and Mark, their BFF (Best Friend Forever) were bored. They had played all day but now that it was dark and difficult to see, they had nothing to do.
They couldn’t play soccer because they couldn’t see the ball. They didn’t want to go inside and play a game because it was a beautiful springtime night and they liked being outside, especially after having to play inside all winter long. They just didn’t know what to do and it was a little too early for them to go home.
“I guess I’ll just go home,” Mark said in a sad voice. “Aww come on,” replied James. “We still have time for another game of – of something.”
Then Sally said, “I have an idea! Let’s play Hide-and Seek.”
“I was just going to say that,” James said. “Yah, I’ll bet,” replied his sister. “You always say you were thinking of whatever I think of,” she snapped. “Do not!” James said in a loud voice. “Do too,” yelled Sally.
Mark just looked down at the ground and shook his head from side to side. “They are at it again,” he mumbled to himself. Then he yelled, “Okay, let’s play Hide-and-Seek
I’ll be the seeker!”
He turned, faced a big tree, closed his eyes, and started counting out loud. “100 – 99 – 98 – 97 …..” Sally and Mark stopped arguing, looked at each other, and ran off in different directions to find a hiding place.
In the distance they could still hear Mark counting
 “4 – 3 – 2 – 1. Ready or not, here
I come!” Then he turned and began looking for places 
where they could be hiding.
Finding Sally was easy.
She always ran off and then circled back
so she would be close to “base,”
the safe place to get to before being tagged.
Mark looked for the biggest tree
and ran towards it.
But she wasn’t there.
“I’ll bet she’s behind that big bush,”
he said to himself.
So he ran to it and was ready to tag her,
but she wasn’t there either.
As he turned around, he saw James running towards
“base” and darted after him. Just before
he touched James’ shoulder, James tagged the “base”
and yelled out “SAFE!” “Did you get Sally yet?”
James asked. “No,” said Mark.
“I haven’t been able to find her and it’s getting late and
we need to be heading home.”
So both boys yelled out
“Come on out Sally, it’s late.”
But there was no reply.
Not even a little snicker from
somewhere in the darkness.
They yelled again.
“Come on out Sally, it’s late.”
Still there was no reply from Sally.
They began to worry and started searching for her. As they walked around the area they called out “Sally, come on, we give up; you’re safe.”
But no matter where they looked,
or how much they called out,
Sally was wondering what had happened.
All she could remember was
crawling under the big trunk
of a fallen tree to hide.
Now, as she looked up, she saw
several stars through a small hole above her head.
She had fallen into a hole
when she crawled under the tree trunk.
“Help!” she yelled and heard her voice
echo throughout what must have been a cave.
“HELP! Help, help, help!”
“Did you hear that, James?”
Mark said excitedly.
“Sally just yelled for help.”
“Keep yelling Sally,” James screamed.
“That way we can find you.”
Sally heard her brother and
kept screaming. After a short while the boys were standing next to the big tree trunk.
“Hey! Are you stuck under this tree?”
asked James. “Kind of,” Sally yelled.
“When I crawled under
it to hide, I fell into a cave.
Please help me, I’m scared.
It’s dark and I can’t get out.”
Mark said,
“James you stay with Sally and
I will go get my dad.”
Then he dashed off into the darkness.
“Don’t be scared,” James said.
“I am right here with you.”
“No, you’re not,” Sally sobbed.
“You’re up there and I’m down here.”
As Sally turned in the darkness of the cave,
she bumped into something,
screamed, and began to cry.
“What’s wrong?” James yelled.
“There’s something down here with me,”
Sally replied in a shaky voice.
Just then, Mark and his dad came
running through the woods.
Mark’s father knelt down and asked Sally
if she was okay. He could hear her crying and sobbing. “Sally, are you hurt?”
he asked. “No,” she said.
“But I’m scared and there is
something down here with me.”
“Stand back Sally.
I am lowering a rope and
will be down with you in a second.”
Mark’s dad tied the rope to the tree,
found the hole under the tree trunk,
wiggled a bit, and lowered
himself into the cave.
Sally could see him coming down
the rope and stopped crying.
Not only was he there but the cave became 
brighter from the beam of
his flashlight as it danced
across the cave’s floor and walls.
As he reached the floor of the cave,
he shone the light on Sally and gave
her a big hug. “Don’t be frightened,”
he said. “I’ll have you out of here in no time.” 
Then he shone the light around
and saw that she had fallen into a small cave. 
And very close to her,
in the middle of the cave,
was something wrapped in layers
of old blankets.
“Mark, James, there’s something down here. 
I am going to tie it to the rope and I want you to 
pull it out.” “Okay,” they replied.
The boys pulled out the object, untied it,
and let the loose end of
the rope fall back into the cave.
The cave wasn’t deep and Marks’
dad boosted Sally over his head so she could 
crawl out. He then grabbed
the rope and with a little jump, was
able to grab the opening
and pull himself out.
“Let’s go back to my house for a cup of hot tea.
I’ll call your parents so they aren’t worried,
and we’ll see what treasure Sally found.” He said.
When they got to Mark’s house,
they sipped their tea and began unwrapping the treasure.
They carefully peeled off layers of old blankets
and cloth to reveal a wooden box.
They slowly opened it and stared in amazement.
“Oh my,” Sally said in disbelief.
“I don’t believe what I am seeing.”
The boys and Mark’s father just stared.
Inside the box were jewels of every color you could imagine. There were diamonds,rubies, sapphires, and emeralds 
of all shapes and sizes.Intermixed they could see several
gold coins and strands of pearls.“We’re rich,” the boys screamed. “Not quite,” interrupted Mark’s father. “Someone could have lost this and I don’t think you should plan on spending any of it until we find out a little more. Besides, Sally found it.” “I’ll share it,” Sally said happily. “That’s nice Sally,” replied Marks dad. But the right thing
to do is contact the authorities.”
The next day, the four of them
and Sally’s mother drove to the police station, 
explained what had happened,
and gave the treasure to the police to hold while 
they conducted their investigation.
They left the police station sadly
and even the double dipped ice cream cones 
Mark’s father bought for them
didn’t make them smile.They drove back in silence.
Several weeks passed with
no word from the police.
Then, one evening, Mark’s father
called James, Sally, and their parents.
“The police just called and
I think you should come over right now,”
he said. “I’m afraid there is some
bad news about the treasure.
The police are on their way and
will explain everything when you get here.”
Sally and James didn’t say
much during the ride to Mark’s house.
Sally thought that since it was
“bad news” the treasure belonged
to someone else, even though
they probably lost it.
“Whatever happened to ‘finders-keepers’?”
she mumbled. “What did you say Sally?”
her mother asked. “Oh, nothing.”
Sally replied. Then she let out
a long, sad sigh that echoed
through the car.
When they arrived at Mark’s house,
the police were there with the treasure box.
As Sally entered,
the captain introduced himself and said,
“Sally, this is yours.
Your parents need to sign
some papers but the box and its
contents are yours.”
Sally, Mark, and James
shrieked with joy and danced
around the room. Then Sally said,
“What is the bad news?”
The captain smiled and said.
“The treasure is worth more money than
you can imagine and with your
new found wealth comes
great responsibility.” Sally didn’t quite understand 
what the captain was talking about and right now
it really didn’t matter.
Mark asked,
“Are you going to share?”
“Of course,” Sally said.
“If you and James didn’t help me
I might still be there.”
Several days later Sally asked
everyone over to her house.
“I have decided what to do with
the money from the treasure after it is sold,”
she said.
“I am giving 1/6 to our Mom and Dad,
1/6 to Mark’s Mom and Dad,
1/6 to Mark, 1/6 to James, and 1/6 for me.”
“There is an extra 1/6,”
Mark proudly stated. He loved math
and was right on top of Sally’s calculations.
“No there’s not,” Sally said.
“Is too,” James said. “Is not,”
Sally said in an angered voice. Just as
Mark was going to say,
“They are at it again,” Sally said,
“This is why there isn’t an extra 1/6!
I am giving it to the local charity, so
it can be given to those less 
fortunate and in need.”
Her mother and father said
it was a caring and responsible thing to do.
They were very proud of her and knew that she
understood what the captain meant when he had turned
the treasure over to her just days before.",HIDE AND SEEK,,4-12
1,"Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Ginger. Ginger lived in Kenya, a country in Africa. Like all giraffes, Ginger had a long neck and long legs. Because she was so tall, she was able to eat food from the very tops of the trees in the savannah.  The savannah in Africa is an area with lots of grass and some trees. Sometimes, a savannah is called grasslands. The other animals like zebras and antelopes could not reach where Ginger could reach.  But Ginger always found food.  She loved the leaves and the new buds of the trees. 
One day, Ginger was busy eating her favorite leaves along with some other giraffes. It was a bright sunny day and there was not a cloud in the sky. It had not rained for a long time, so the grass was very dry. She heard a noise down at the bottom of her extra long legs: it was her friend, Mickey the Monkey. Mickey was trying to say something, but Ginger couldn’t understand what he was saying. He looked very tired. “What’s wrong?” asked Ginger. Ginger was a very kind giraffe and wanted to help everyone. 
Just then Mickey fell over!
Ginger was also a smart giraffe. She knew what was wrong. Mickey couldn’t find anything to eat and he was very hungry. Ginger nibbled some fresh, tender leaves and buds from the top of the tree where she was eating. She dropped some of the leaves and buds to the ground near where Mickey was. Then she nudged him a little with the hoof at the bottom of one of her very long legs. “Wake up, Mickey!” said Ginger. 
“I’ve found something for you to eat.” 
Slowly Mickey sat up and ate a little.
After a while, when Mickey was feeling better, Ginger asked him, “What’s happened, Mickey? Why are you so hungry? Why can’t you find anything to eat?” Mickey said, “It hasn’t rained for so long and now there’s no more food.” “That’s not good,” said Ginger. “What’s happening with the other animals?” “No one knows what to do,” answered Mickey. “All the zebras and the antelopes and the elephants are getting worried about the dry grass. 
Some of them are thinking about leaving the savannah and trying to reach the jungle.” 
“That’s a long trip,” said Ginger. 
“Are you going to go with them?”
“I don’t know,” answered Mickey. “What do you think we should do?” Ginger thought for a while and then suddenly, she had a good idea. “We should go talk to Leo the Lion. 
He is the smartest animal in the savannah!” Mickey was too tired to walk, so Ginger invited him to ride on her back. “Hold on tight to my neck,” said Ginger. “There’s a lot to hold on to,” joked Mickey. Ginger laughed. “You’re right. I’ve got the longest neck in Africa!” So they started their journey across to the other side of the savannah to look for Leo.
Ginger and Mickey were in luck!  Leo was sitting up on a rock and he was really easy to see as they walked through the grass.  “Hi, Leo!” they both shouted.  Leo had been napping and was a little grumpy when they woke him up.  But he was polite and said, “Hello Ginger and Mickey.  Why did you walk the whole way across the savannah?  Just to wake me up?”  But he was joking; he had a smile on his face.  “Mickey says that there is no food left on the savannah because it’s been so dry,” said Ginger.  “Do you have any ideas?”
Leo thought for a while. He said, “There’s nothing we can do about the rain. It will come soon, but we can’t be sure when it will arrive. When the rain comes, all the plants will grow again and there will be lots of food for everybody.” 
He thought a little longer. “The only thing I can think of is for everyone to move closer to the forest,” he continued. “There will be more things to eat there, but I know it’s a long trip and it will not be very easy. 
It might take days to get there.”
Ginger and Mickey looked at each other and then looked back at Leo. “Thank you, Leo,” said Ginger. “It’s probably best if they all try to get closer to the jungle.” They said goodbye and then walked back across the savannah. 
Now they needed to gather all of the animals together to start the long journey. Ginger didn’t need to go along because she had plenty of food in her high trees. But she was a good friend and wanted to help as much as she could. 
They walked towards her favorite trees and guess what she and Mickey saw?
All of the animals were already gathered there and waiting for Ginger and Mickey! “Why are you all here?” asked Ginger. “Eddie the Eagle told us that you’re taking us to the edge of the jungle,” said one of the zebras. “How did he know?” asked Mickey. “He heard you talking with Leo,” said one of the antelopes. “So you’ve all decided to try to walk together to the jungle?” asked Ginger. “Yes,” they all answered. “If you’ll help us to get there,” added one of the elephants. 
 “Of course, I’ll help,” said Ginger. “I’m your friend.”
So they started on their big journey across the savannah to the jungle. The sun was so hot and there was no food and no place to get a drink of water. And then they heard it. It was thunder! “Thunder!” they all shouted. Thunder was very scary to the animals of the savannah. Can you guess why? Fire! Sometimes the lightning hits the dry grass and the whole savannah catches fire. Then everyone has to run. And that is exactly what happened. “Fire!” they shouted. They 
could smell it. And now they could see it. 
The fire was coming towards them!
Ginger had to think fast. Because she was so tall she could see farther than any of the other animals. 
She stretched her long neck up as far 
as she could. Now she could see a place where there was no fire. “Quick!” she said. “Everyone run this way.” 
All of the animals followed her 
and ran as fast as they could. Soon, they were 
out of danger. They stopped and gathered together one more time. “Is everyone here?” Ginger asked. She wanted to make sure they were all safe. 
All the animals looked around; they were all there.
And then the most wonderful thing happened. “I felt a drop,” said a zebra. “Me too,” said an antelope. It was rain! Finally! Everyone was very happy. It started to rain a little more and then a little more. The rain put out the fire so they didn’t have to run. And the rain filled their watering holes and made the plants grow again, 
so they didn’t have to make that long trip to the edge of the jungle. Everyone would soon have enough food and water. So Ginger, the Giraffe went back to her favorite tree and continued to munch on the leaves and buds.",Ginger The Giraffe ,,4-12
2,"I like doing my chores.
Well, maybe not all of them but most of them. 
Hmm, maybe not most of them. But a lot of them.
Okay, maybe not a lot of them. But a few of them. 
Well, maybe not a few of them but … None of them!
Just fooling … I really do like doing my chores.
When I do my chores, it helps my Mommy and Daddy, and as you know Mummies and Daddies sometimes need a lot of help.
Sometimes I have chores that I do not like to do. 
When that happens I make up a silly game and that makes the chore easier.
Like yesterday, I had to put my laundry away and
I pretended that I was hiding it from my Mommy. 
It was fun and I think I remember where I put it. 
Just fooling … It is in my dresser where it belongs.
Sometimes when all my chores are done, we go to the park or have other special time. 
I know if my chores weren’t done we wouldn’t be able to do that.

3,"“Hi, I am Abe and I am a Service Dog.
When I was a puppy, my owner told me I would be a Service Dog for a person who could not see. I didn’t know what that meant,
but I knew it was something special.
When I got a little older, I was sent away to school.
My sister was sent to another school 
to learn how to help people with Autism.
To be their friend and help them get around.
One of my other brothers was sent to a special school so he could learn how to warn people that they were going to get sick before they did. 
My other brothers and sisters became good friends with people in good families. 
Not every dog can become a Service Dog.
School was hard. 
I had to learn many things just like you.
I had to learn to stop and look before crossing the street.
And learn what a red, yellow, and green directional light meant and what I should do.
I was taught how to guide a person to go left, right, to step up and down, to stop, to move forward a little, to back up, and much more.
I had to learn where I was and how to get back, even in strange areas.
I had to learn how to behave in a restaurant and never, ever, beg for food. That was hard.
I had to learn that I could be a plain old playful dog as long as my halter was off.
But once it was on… I was working.
I became the eyes of my master and their safety and how they got around was up to me.
After a long time in school, I graduated and my trainer introduced me to BJ.
The person who would become my master. We were both excited.
We trained together for several weeks and became very good friends. 
She was really nice and we always spent fun-time together once she took my halter off.
One day the trainer said we were ready and I was off to a new home with my master and friend.
We shared many years together and had many wonderful experiences.
We went shopping, visited friends, ate in fine restaurants, and traveled across the country.
I took care of BJ.
I knew when she didn’t feel right and could tell if she was happy or unhappy, sad, grumpy, or whatever.
I would always try to make things better for her.
BJ took care of me.
She knew when I didn’t feel right and could tell if I were happy or unhappy, sad, grumpy, or whatever.
She would always try to make things better for me.
A long time has passed and now I can’t help my friend any more.
BJ is off to school again and training with a new Service Dog.
I will meet him tomorrow and help him understand his new master.
Then I become like my other brothers and sisters.
I become a good friend for people in a good family.

4,"The sun shone brightly over the meadow as Class 1 
of Sunny Meadows Woodland School 
set off for their first trip to the Shadow Woods. 
Everyone was excited to be going on the adventure that they had been talking about for weeks. Their teacher, Miss Squirrel, had promised a trip to remember and the whole class now skipped excitedly through the meadow. Well, nearly all of the class; alone at the back of the group waddled Hank. Hank was a hedgehog who found it difficult to make friends. He always felt like the outsider. The others in the class, especially Matilda Mouse, kept away from Hank because they thought him odd. 
Yes, Hank was not really looking forward to the day. 
The journey to the Shadow Woods was longer than expected because Mr. Mole’s tunnel train was broken. Indeed Mr. Mole was there waving them off before he got back to work. This just made Miss Squirrel happier though, as she could talk to the children about all the wonderful flowers that filled Sunny Meadow. There was color everywhere. It looked as if a rainbow had crashed into the field. 
However, at the edge of the meadow, not everyone was looking at the flowers…
Soon though, the Shadow Woods were upon them and something that looked small from far away suddenly grew very large before them. Each member of the class gave a slow gulp-Matilda Mouse, Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph Racoon. The biggest gulp came from Hank. He was nervous enough before they got to the woods and didn’t have a friend to hold on to.  Matilda pretended to be brave, however, and ran on ahead compelling her friends to join her.  
Miss Squirrel was not happy about that and so she shouted for Matilda to come back. Then off she chased after her. Soon the whole class followed and before they knew it, they were right in the middle of the woods. Now instead of bright sunshine, only shadows scattered before them.
The class stopped, their little mouths open in awe and wonder. Miss Squirrel was still chasing Matilda though and did not notice that she had left the little ones behind. Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph Racoon all held paws as they looked around them. Three very small friends.And Hank.The only noise now in the woods was silence.
Suddenly, everyone got a fright as behind them Matilda mouse jumped from behind a berry-bush and shouted “BOO!” as loudly as she could. After they all had stopped shaking, her friends laughed.All except Hank. “Silly Hank,” said Matilda. 
“You are just no fun!”
However, before Hank could reply, another noise made everyone turn around. This time though there was no Boo! of surprise and no laughter afterwards because there before the class was a very large and very hungry snake. His magical eyes twinkling with delight as his tongue spiked forward. “Mmmm!! Lunchtime.” said the snake.
It was at this point that the class realised that Miss Squirrel had not returned from chasing Matilda. The class was alone. Squeaks of fright squeezed out of the little animals’ mouths. Matilda and her friends all hugged each other fearing that this was the end.
Suddenly though, Hank was scared no more. He found a way to save the class. He knew just what he had to do. “Quick everyone- down this hole.” he shouted as he pointed to a hole under a hanging chestnut Tree. The animals stared at him and then jumped down the hole. Hank followed only to be stopped by Matilda who looked very angry. 
“Hank, we are trapped now- you foolish hog.” But before she could add to her insult, Hank jumped up and flipped himself into a ball. Next, he rolled towards the mouth of the hole and blocked it with his pointy sharp spikes. There would be no lunch for the snake today! 
Later, back at school, Miss Squirrel was telling the head teacher, Mr Owl, about what had happened and how the snake had fled Hank’s pointy spikes. After the snake had slithered away, the class had quickly returned to school and each one had thanked their new friend Hank.
 
Matilda gave him a big hug and apologised for what she had called him before. Hank was not odd, he was a hero and her new best friend. Hank, who was still unused to lots of attention, turned pink and popped into a ball as all his new friends 
cheered him.",SUNNY MEADOWS WOODLAND SCHOOL,,4-12
5,"Incisor was tall and skinny with short pink hair, Canine was also tall with blue hair and Molar was the short, wise one with curly, silver locks. 
All day long the busy little fairies cleaned and shined the children’s milk teeth they had collected during the night.
The milk teeth were used to make very useful things in the Ordon Gardens like roads in the village and furniture in the homes for the little fairies.
One day Incisor realised that the teeth coming into the cleaning factory were not as strong as they used be.
“Oh dear!” said Incisor “These teeth are fragile and brittle, with holes and black spots. They crumble as soon as I try to polish them with my cloth. Whatever are we to do?”
“Yes.”said Canine “I know exactly what’s wrong, The children are beginning to eat far too many sweets and are not looking after their teeth at all.” “I know…we can fix it!” Said Molar the wise one. She sounded quite excited by her grand idea.
The three fairies looked at each other and waited while Molar explained all. As usual, it was a fabulous idea. The three of them wasted no time at all and got to work straight away.
That night, it was Canine’s turn to fly off and collect all the milk teeth from under the sleeping children’s pillow. Off she flew with a bag of coins, some white berry sandwiches for her lunch and a pack of cards which the three fairies had spent all afternoon preparing.
It was such a treat to leave the forest and see the city skyline but it was a dangerous place for fairies. Canine had to make sure that the big people never saw her.
 
 
She flew through the starry sky and saw the wonderful city fast asleep.
Her first stop was a young boy named Junior.
Earlier in the night Junior and his mum had placed his milk tooth under the pillow. Mummy tucked Junior into bed and told him all about the tooth fairy who would leave some money in exchange for his tooth. She gave him a goodnight kiss and left him to fall asleep.
By the time Canine arrived, Junior was fast asleep. She flew in through the top window that was ajar and glided quickly down to Junior’s pillow. She perched beside him and braced herself in preparation for the task…
“Heave……..” she lifted the pillow and wedged herself between the pillow and the bed. She quickly grabbed the tooth and tossed it over to her backpack.
She placed two coins and the fairy’s special card in exchange under the
pillow and flew off into the night sky to find more milk teeth.
In the morning, as soon as Junior woke up, he rummaged under the pillow to see if the tooth fairy had left any money for him. 
He was thrilled to find the coins but looked blankly at the card he found in his hand. Mummy didn’t mention anything about a card…he wondered.
 
He read the card out aloud… 
The Tooth Fairy’s guide to healthy teeth:
1.Eat Healthy.
2.Cut down on sugary sweets & drinks.
3.Brush your teeth twice a day.
4.Use a fluoride toothpaste.
5.Visit the Dentist regularly.
Back in the village of Ordon Gardens, the fairies were very happy about the new information card they were giving to the children. Soon enough the milk teeth coming into the factory were strong and healthy again.",TOOTH FAIRY,,4-12

Peterson said aloud, as she reviewed the huge stack of reports on her desk.“I think I will handle this one myself.” 
After several minutes of searching through the official Tooth Fairy records, she found what she was looking for. A folder with the name‘Sophia Sue Simmons’. 
“Hmm,” Detective Peterson mumbled as she studied the file. 
As Detective Peterson read the report, she noted that Sophia Sue always smiled. From the time she got out of bed to the time she went back to bed, she smiled. In fact, Sophia Sue never seemed to stop smiling. 
Then, two days ago, Sophia Sue stopped smiling. “Why?”Detective Peterson wondered.“I must find out why and get Sophia Sue’s smile back,”she said to herself.
She searched through the file but couldn’t find anything that could have caused Sophia Sue to stop smiling all of a sudden. 
 
Was she happy at home? The Smile-O-Meter indicated “yes.”
Was she happy at school? The Smile-O-Meter indicated “yes.”
Was she happy with her friends? The Smile-O-Meter indicated “yes.”
Everything that Detective Peterson found indicated that Sophia Sue was happy and that she should be smiling.
The Detective checked with the dentist and everything was fine.
The Detective checked with Tooth Fairy Central. All of Sophia Sue’s baby teeth had fallen out, been collected as scheduled, and replaced with new, extremely pretty, permanent teeth.
Detective Peterson checked everything but she couldn’t find anything that could cause Sophia Sue to stop smiling. 
There was only one choice left.Detective Peterson had to visit Sophia Sue and see what she could do. 
That night Detective Peterson flew down and visited Sophia Sue.
Making sure that she didn’t wake Sophia Sue, she sprinkled magical Tooth Fairy sand into the air. 
“Sophia Sue.” Detective Peterson whispered. “What happened 
to your beautiful smile?You look so sad.”
“I lost all my baby teeth,”she whispered. “Now the Tooth Fairy doesn’t have any reason to visit me.” 
“Oh! I understand,” Detective Peterson whispered between smiling lips. “The Tooth Fairy will always be in your heart so you can wipe that silly frown off your pretty face.” 
 
 As Detective Peterson flew away from Sophia Sue’s bedside, she saw the smile return - bigger and brighter than ever before.",THE CASE OF THE MISSING SMILE,,4-12
8,"When Jamal opened the door, his mother could tell 
something was wrong. He looked like he was going to cry.
“Jamal, what is the matter?” his mother asked.
“HOMEWORK!” he shouted. “Homework ! Yuck! 
I will not do any more homework.”
Now, Jamal’s mother was quite concerned. 
She had never heard Jamal talk like that and she had no idea that he didn’t like doing his homework.
In fact, each time she asked Jamal if he had done his homework, he would always answer “yes”.
“My teacher wants to meet with you,” Jamal said.
“That’s fine,” his mother said. 
“But I would like to talk to you before
we meet with your teacher. 
I think now is the perfect time,”
Jamal and his mother talked for a long time and all the while his mother was writing things down. Jamal chuckled to himself as she wrote. It was as if she was doing homework, and do you know what? She was.
Then his mother said, “Jamal, now that we are done, I want you to do the best you can on your homework tonight. Tomorrow morning we will go to school together.” Jamal agreed and his mother continued with her homework.
The next day Jamal, his mother, and his teacher met before school started.
 Jamal was frightened. He didn’t know what to expect and it was all his fault for not doing his homework.
“Homework! Yuck!” he mumbled to himself. “I heard that,” his teacher said. 
Then his mother spoke, “Jamal and I discussed the situation last night and I assure you he will be doing his homework in the future.
I also think you need to listen to his reasons. They are reasons, and not excuses. Please let Jamal explain to you as he did to me.”
Well, Jamal was really frightened now. He had to talk to the teacher and tell her why he didn’t do his homework. 
Jamal thought for a moment, took a deep breath, and began talking.
“I need time to have some fun. I spend all day in school and then my teachers want me to spend the rest of the day doing homework.” 
“I like to spend time with my mother, brother, and sister. I also have to do my chores and help my mom since my dad doesn’t live with us.” 
“When I really try to do my homework, it takes too long and I can’t help my mom. I know this makes her sad and sometimes angry.” 
“Sometimes I get so much homework I have to copy some of it from my friends. I know that is cheating, but I want to turn something in.” 
“When I have done my homework it takes so long to get it back that I can’t learn from it. Meanwhile, you are teaching something else. I just get lost.”
Jamal’s teacher thought for a moment and then said: “I never realized you were so smart. You have made some very good points and I need to consider them. In fact, all the teachers need to hear  them. I will consider your comments before I assign homework in the future. I would like you to talk to all the teachers. Will you do that?”
Jamal agreed and he spoke to all the teachers, parents, and students at the school’s next Open House. He was frightened but he made excellent points. In fact, the school changed the way they assigned homework. It was easier on the students and they were able to complete it and learn. They also had some time to play and spend time with their families.
Now, Jamal does his homework and actually looks forward to doing it. Now his mother doesn’t have to ask if it is done.",HOMEWORK - YUCK!,,4-12

Princess Aura always has the best birthday parties and this year friends from all over the galaxy were heading to her planet to enjoy the celebrations. Captain Fantastic and his wonder dog Winston had picked the perfect present for their inspiring friend. However, Captain Fantastic’s arch nemesis, the evil Doctor Zob was determined that there would be no birthday cake for the pair at the end of this trip.
The Rocketship stood proudly on the launch pad ready for takeoff. Captain Fantastic had just finished loading Princess Aura’s awkwardly long birthday present. “That’s it, Winston.” he said patting his faithful dog. “Now I just need to go and return all this wrapping paper.”and he headed towards the hanger while untangling himself from all the super sticky tape he’d 
used to wrap up the gift.
Winston gave a happy bark and off Captain Fantastic went into the space hanger. As Winston returned to the spaceship he thought he saw someone walking away from their Rocket Ship. 
He looked familiar; was that Doctor Zob?
Later, in the ship all systems were go. Lights blinked, screens lit up and Captain Fantastic and Winston were strapped in ready to go. 
“5,4,3,2,1, Blast Off and away we go.” shouted Captain Fantastic, a big grin on his face whenever he headed back out into space. Today Winston 
only gave a little whimper though; 
what was that Doctor Zobup to?
On Doctor Zob’s great black ship however, 
there was only laughter, the kind only an evil 
genius can produce; deep from the stomach 
and exploding from the mouth. 
“Good luck Captain Fantastic, 
enjoy your ride.”
Both ships were now busy with the sound of song:
“Roaring in our Rocket, flying really fast,
Being in a spaceship is a blast blast blast!” 
sang Captain Fantastic.
While on the dark ship of Zob his creepy 
chorus rang out:
“My mean machine is in the socket.
It will make the Captain Fluster.
Magnetic power will route his rocket
To the Crazy Comet Cluster”
“Not long now, Winston. Princes Aura’s planet is just around the next sun.” explained Captain Fantastic. Out of the window Winston stared at the golden planets, and the shining suns flying past as they hurtled through space.
“WahWahWah”. The cool hum of the spaceship was suddenly thrown into chaos as the red warning light flashed and the ship suddenly and sharply turned around. 
“Oh no!” cried Captain Fantastic. “We’re going the wrong way”. Winston looked at the screen and saw where they were headed: “Oh no, indeed!”
The yellow rocket ship was now headed towards 
the Crazy Comet Cluster, the zaniest place in space. Hundreds of blazing red comets swarmed around a golden Yellow sun and if a spaceship got too close, they would chase and churn it for hours upon hours.
Winston barked and ran to the back of the ship. “Don’t worry, boy.” said Captain Fantastic. “It will be ok….I hope.” as he started pressing buttons and fighting with the spaceships steering wheel. Sweat broke out on his forehead and his eyes widened 
into two moons of panic.
Winston was not really scared, however, he was searching for whatever the mischievous Doctor Zob had hidden on their ship. Winston knew that it was the only reason they were in trouble, but what was it?
Watching from behind a small green moon was the shadowy spaceship of Doctor Zob. A big smile of satisfaction grew on his face as he watched the Captain’s ship head towards the Crazy Comet Cluster. Once again his evil laugh echoed around the gleaming cockpit of his ship.“Magnetic force, keep that rocket off course.”he whispered to himself.
Winston knew they were almost out of time when he saw it; or rather he sniffed out the evil stench of where Doctor Zob had been. It was a small blinking box just underneath the main computer. That had to be it. Doctor Zob had made the yellow rocket go in the wrong direction using one of his mischief machines. Quick as a flash Winston snatched the box in his jaws and teetering along the lengthy birthday gift threw it to the Space Particle Accelerator Machine (SPAM for short).He then used his paws and sent the device back to Doctor Zob’s nearby ship. ‘Lets see how much he enjoys those crazy comets.’ thought Winston.
Back on the bridge Captain Fantastic was 
still banging, twisting pushing and pressing everything he could, When suddenly the ship turned around and headed back to Princess Aura’s planet. Winston trotted in and gave a friendly happy bark. “I told you not to worry Winston; as I say ‘with the Captain around a solution is found.’”
Winston gave a happy bark before picking up his favourite bone and settling back to enjoy the remainder of the journey. 
A short while later Captain Fantastic and Winston were getting hugs and high fives as Princess Aura opened up her birthday present.“Anti-Gravity skies! “Cool!” she said while up above some crazy comets were chasing a rather unhappy Doctor Zob.",CAPTAIN FANTASTIC,,4-12
10,"Dylan the young, blue
 dragon lived deep in the Rockstone Mountains of Scotland. Everyday the playful, young dragon woke up early in the morning and flew all around the mountains and valleys looking for something to do.
When he was hungry he would go home to his cave where Mummy dragon would have hot soup ready for his dinner.
“Wash your wings and get ready for tea. I’ve made your favourite today, darling… pea and toad soup” said mummy dragon.
Dylan sighed, “Ehhh…Thank you mum.” 
he said sadly.
“Whatever is the matter, son?
 Everyday you come back home happily for your tea but today you look so sad.” 
inquired mummy dragon.
“I’m lonely, mum. I can’t find 
anyone to play with. In all the lakes, mountains and valleys in Rockstone, there isn’t a single dragon for me to play with.”
 he grumbled
“Well, how about this for an idea? Why don’t you fly down to the 
village playground and see if the children there want to play 
with you?”
Dylan woke up bright and early the next day. He was very excited that he would soon have friends to play with everyday. 
He put on his baseball cap and school tie and flew past the valleys and mountains until he reached the little village of Falkrik.
He glided down to a passer-by 
to ask for directions to 
the children’s playground.
“That.. that.. that way.” pointed the quivering man.
“Oh! He must be cold.” thought Dylan. After all 
human’s don’t breath fire like dragons… so they must find it very difficult to keep warm.
Not long after, Dylan the 
dragon came in for a swift landing in the centre of the playground. The playground was filled with smart young children in bright red and grey uniforms with their school ties. Dylan tugged at his tie and cleared his throat, He felt very well dressed for the occasion. 
He was about to open his mouth to introduce himself when he suddenly heard…
“AAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!! 
ruuuunnnnnnnnn It’s a dragon, he’s going to burn us ALIVE!!!!!!!” yelled one of the young boys. 
All the children ran frantically
 towards the exits and 
disappeared in no time.
Dylan sighed sadly. All he wanted was some friends  to play with but clearly humans were very scared of dragons.
He flew home with his head hung low to see what mummy dragon had made for tea.
The next day Dylan decided to try and make friends with the children in the playground again. He tucked his white handkerchief in his left gill and scooped up a large  branch lying on the floor. He made it into a white surrender flag… He crossed his claws and hoped the children would give him a another chance.
Down he flew again into the 
centre of the playground with his white surrender flag clenched in his jaw. “I just want to play and be friends.” he said softly.
“But how will you play with us?” shouted one of the girls. “Your’re too big for our swings and slides. You won’t fit in our roundabout.”
“Well, why don’t I take you all for a ride to the valleys and the mountains of Rockstone?”
“Yay!!” squealed all the children at once. They climbed onto Dylan’s back and off the children went on a very exciting flight.
From that day Dylan 
and the playground 
children were friends and every day Dylan, the dragon would take the children on the best 
playground ride ever.",DYLAN THE DRAGON,,4-12
11,"All the animals of the forest tease 
Jessie the rabbit about her shy ways. But when a friend is in trouble, it is the shy Jessie who saves the day with her courage and quick thinking.
 “I may look stupid and scared, but I will always be prepared for danger.” thought Jessie. He would hide and curl up every time he heard a crack or saw a shadow loom over his hole. 
Trampling everything, the animals ran away, 
leaving behind a cloud of dust and the forest on fire. Only Jessie was left in his hiding place, safe beneath the ground. Jessie had cleverly stashed away a supply of food and water in his hole. He knew that one day danger would come and he wanted to be prepared. He was relieved to know he had enough supplies to last until the fire was over.
In the distance, Jessie could hear a loud squeal “Help! Someone, help me, please.” Jessie did not want to come out of his hole, as he knew that the fire was spreading. But then he heard the squeal a second and third time. Jessie couldn’t just hide in his hole while someone was out there on his own.  
The Jessie was very scared but he couldn’t just leave Teddy there. Huffing and puffing, he rushed with incredible speed towards the Teddy. ‘Jessie, please, you need to find a way to get this thing off!’ said Teddy. Jessie started running around, looking for a way to help.",JESSIE THE RABBIT,,4-12
12,"Little Betty was walking through their vegetable garden when all of a sudden she began to scream.“Bugs, ugly creepy bugs!They’re all over the place.”
“What’s all the fuss?”her grandfather enquired.“Yuck! There are so many nasty critters all over our vegetables. I’m afraid to pick any for dinner tonight. Let’s just start to squish them.Yikes, bad bug, bad bug, get off me.”
“Betty, wait! Don’t hurt him.That’s a praying mantis and he is a good bug,” 
her grandfather said,as he gently brushed the praying mantis off her. Betty asked, “What do you mean by ‘good bug’?” 
“Just because it’s a bug, or we don’t understand it, or like the way it looks, doesn’t make it bad,” he said.“There are bugs that eat or kill our vegetables.I think those are bad bugs. Then there are bugs that eat or chase away those bad bugs. I think they are good bugs.In fact, I put good bugs in my garden so I don’t have to use chemicals to chase away the bad bugs.I have an idea. Let’s go on a safari. It will help you understand.”
“A safari!” she exclaimed. “Let’s go!” Betty’s grandfather then explained that she would have to use her imagination to make them very small, so that they could go on a safari into the world of the insects. In a flash, they were there. Betty was a little frightened but she knew that
it was all imaginary.
“What do we do now?” she whispered.“Just walk slowly and observe and I will explain about all of the good bugs I put in the garden,”he replied.
“Over there is that praying mantis that landed on you. He eats flies and some bad beetles.And because he is big, he has big pincers and can give you quite a pinch.”
LadyBugs, and other similar beetles,eat little tiny aphids, mites, and other soft-bodied bugs and their eggs.
Spined soldier bugs (stink bugs) feed on all sorts of garden pests. But don’t accidentally squish one of these, they really smell.
There are many more but it’s getting late.We need to get back to picking vegetables for our dinner. We can go on a safari to the world of the insects again tomorrow.”
“grandpa, that was great!” Betty shrieked with joy.“I now understand what you meant by good bugs.And I realize that even though they are good, they can still bite or sting, so I’ll be real careful.”

14,"Not long ago, in a crystal-clear river, near a small town lived two very big fish.In fact, they were so big that they were not afraid of anything.They swam anywhere they wanted.
They tangled the lines of children fishing in their river.They ate when they were hungry and splashed anyone sitting on the bank.They were the big, brave rulers of the crystal-clear river.
One day, a large bullfrog and his family moved into the area.The bullfrog saw the two big, brave fish in the crystal-clear river and wanted to talk to them.But he was afraid. 
He didn’t know a lot about the crystal-clear river,or the big brave fish that lived there, and was afraid of being eaten.
For a long time he watched the big, brave fish, the crystal-clear river, and 
everything around him to make sure it was safe.The bullfrog was very smart and used his common sense to guide him.Then, with a mighty hop, he jumped into the crystal-clear river to introduce himself.
“I’m Kroaker, the biggest and smartest bullfrog in the world.” he said.“Is that so?” replied one of the fish.“We are the biggest and bravest fish in the crystal-clear river.”The other fish looked at Kroaker and said. “If you are nice we may let you share our water.”The three talked and over time, the two big, brave fish and Kroaker became friends.Every day the three of them would meet at the same spot in the crystal-clear river to eat, talk, and play.
Late one evening, as the three were talking,two fishermen passed by. 
Kroaker saw them, and common sense told him to hop into the water and hide under the bank.The two big, brave fish slowly swam in circles so the fishermen could see just how big they were.
One of the fishermen saw them and said, “This crystal-clear river has some really big fish.Let’s come back tomorrow morning and catch them.” 
As the fishermen turned and walked away, they discussed what type of bait might work best to catch big, brave fish.“Worms.” said one.“No,sausages.”
 said the other, and they continued their discussion as they walked the twisty path along the crystal-clear river’s edge.
The two big,brave fish and the Kroaker overheard the fishermen.“My friends,” said Kroaker. “Did you hear what they said?You should swim away and hide.
I am afraid they may catch and eat me, so I will take my family to a nearby pond to be safe.”
The two big, brave fish bubbled out laughs as they jumped in and out of the water.One said, “My dear bullfrog friend, don’t be frightened of their mere talk.” 
Kroaker looked at the two brave fish and said, “I would rather be safe than sorry.”
“From what I heard they might come back so I will leave with my family to the safety of the pond.” Kroaker left and the two big, brave fish swam to the 
bottom of the crystal-clear river.
The next morning, just after sunrise, the two fishermen returned to the crystal-clear river where the day before they had seen the two big, brave fish.They walked slowly and quietly so as not to disturb them. “Look,” whispered 
one of the fishermen,“there they are.”
The fishermen gently cast their bait and let it slowly drift in the current to attract 
the big, brave fish. It worked! In moments, each had hooked one of the big, brave fish.Then the battle between the fishermen and the fish began.
The big, brave fish used all their tricks to free themselves.They dived deep, swam fast, and leaped from the water, thrashing their tail and head in an attempt to get free.The battle raged for over ten minutes but in the end, the big, brave fish were no match for the fishermen. They were caught!
Oh, the anglers were excited! Each had caught a big brave fish on their first cast of the day.What a story they had to tell when they returned home!
Kroaker carefully hopped back to the pond and told his family what he had seen.
“Both my big, brave fish friends were very talented, and still they were caught. 
But I, with only common sense, saved my family.I will miss them.”
“We have to learn a lesson from this,” said Kroaker to his family. “At the first sign of danger, use common sense and act quickly to save yourself.”","KROAKER, THE BULLFROG ",,4-12
15,"“Hi! My name is Sally and I live in New York City,in The United States of America. It’s a chilly, cloudy fall day, and the rain is turning into an icy snowy mixture.I am bored!Last week the weather was beautiful when I had to go to school, but it gets dark early now so I cannot play outside. Now, when I don’t have to go to school, there is an early winter storm brewing.
I am bored!
My big brother, Josh is watching his favorite TV program and, as usual, he won’t let me watch anything I like,or even something we both like.Josh doesn’t like to share.
I am bored!I don’t have any new books to read.I am bored!My Mom is listening to the news on the radio and they are talking about the low temperatures and the surprise winter storm that is moving in. 
I can’t even listen to music.I am bored … bored …… bored! I said aloud.
‘Sally,’ my Mom called out. ‘If you are so bored why don’t you draw a picture or color?’ ""I can’t,"" I said.""I am out of paper.”
Sally was obviously bored. She moped around the apartment for a while, tried to find something to do, but there just wasn’t anything that interested her.
She walked slowly to the window, pressed her nose against the cold glass, and watched the big snowflakes fall from the sky. She looked down and saw that they were already starting to cover the street and sidewalk.
“Oh what a terrible day. I am so bored,”she said with a sigh.
She stayed close to the window and watched some birds land on the telephone wires below her apartment. “They look bored too,”she said to herself.
She watched the cars go up and down the street as they left their tire tracks in the pure, white snow. Across the street, a dog slipped on an icy spot as it chased a cat. She thought she saw the cat turn around and smile, or maybe laugh at the dog as it tried to stop spinning in circles. 
She giggled as the dog started running but couldn’t go anywhere. Its legs were moving, but on the ice, its feet just kept on sliding over the same spot. “Josh, you have to see this,” she called out.But there was no reply.
The snow was coming down faster and faster.Soon it was really deep.
She saw people with shovels trying to clean the sidewalk or an area next to the street so they could park their car.
Some people were walking with open umbrellas that looked like they were made of thick, white cotton candy. She licked her lips as she imagined how good a cotton candy umbrella would taste.Again, she saw the cat and dog slipping and sliding on the slippery sidewalk. She thought for a second and tried to say “slipping and sliding on the slippery sidewalk” three times very fast without making a mistake. “Wow! That is hard,” she thought to herself.
Farther up the street, she saw a man with two little boys starting to roll little balls of snow into big ones.“What are they doing?” she mumbled to herself.She watched them for several more minutes as they stacked the balls of snow on top of one another.She pressed her nose against the window for a closer look.“A snowman,” she shrieked with joy.“They are building a snowman.”
“Mom, can I go out and play?”Sally yelled out to her mother.“Dress warm,” her mother replied.“Be sure to stay close and come in before dark.”In under a minute, Sally was outside playing with her friends and having a lot of fun.Oh! She wasn’t bored anymore either.
The afternoon passed and Sally’s mother knew she would be coming in soon.She also knew that she would probably be chilly and would appreciate a hot cup of cocoa.Her mother thought for a second as 
she looked out the window to check on Sally.
All of a sudden, Josh heard his mother laughing.“Josh, you have to come and see this,”she chuckled. He did and they both laughed at the dog chasing the cat and slipping, and sliding, on the slippery sidewalk.
“Josh, I am going to make some hot cocoa for your sister when she comes in.Would you like a cup?”“You bet,” replied Josh. His mother always made the best hot cocoa.“Hmm, now let me see. Which special recipe should I use from my Pick & Sip Hot Cocoa Recipes?” their mother thought as she looked over their favorites.

“I think I’ll make the Southern Belle hot cocoa, topped with vanilla ice cream, and use a candy cane stirrer.”She said to herself. Just as she finished cooking, the door opened and a red-cheeked Sally came in and took off her gloves, coat, hat, scarf, and boots. “What’s that wonderful smell?” Sally said with a smile. “I hope it’s what I think it is.” All three sat and sipped the hot cocoa while Sally told them about her adventures outside.Sally giggled and said,“And I thought I was bored.”",MIX IT UP ,,4-12

18,"“Wow!” Tristan said as he watched the man on the street corner make bubbles.
Big bubbles, little bubbles, tiny bubbles too. Bubbles from a wand, some landing on his shoe. Bubbles in the air, bubbles on the ground, Bubbles blowing on the wind, making a popping sound.Their colors like a rainbow, their shape so round and true.Bubbles, bubbles everywhere. Look - that one is blue.” Tristan thought to himself. “I just have to find out how to make those bubbles.” So, he walked up to the man and asked him how he did it.
“Excuse me, Sir,” Tristan said.“I have never seen bubbles like that and I would really like to know how to make them.They are the most beautiful things I have ever seen.” The man stopped blowing bubbles, smiled, and said: “Why, thank you young man! When I was about your age, I saw someone blowing bubbles and, well, I asked how he made them. He told me and once I started, I just couldn’t stop.Just a minute, while I blow some more.”
When he finished, he looked at Tristan, grinned, and said, “Would you like to try blowing some?” “Could I?” exclaimed Tristan. Tristan took the wand, dipped it, 
moved it gently through the air, and the biggest bubble he ever saw rose into the sky. He squealed with delight. The man then explained some important things 
to remember when blowing bubbles.
“I can remember that,” Tristan said. “But how do I make the solution and the wands.” “Ah,”The man said in a whisper.“Let me blow some more bubbles 
and then I’ll tell you.” He then took a wand in each hand, dipped them, extended his arms, and began spinning. Soon there was a wall of bubbles. So many bubbles that Tristan couldn’t see the man anymore.Then he heard a laugh and POP!Pop! … Pop! Pop! Pop! … Pop! Pop! … Pop! Pop! … Pop!
When the bubbles were gone, so was the man and lying on the sidewalk was 
a piece of paper.Tristan bent down and picked it up.It was just what he needed to get started. A Bubble Scientist’s Basic Guide Pop! – Remember to experiment with the basic solution.A little more glycerin, sugar, or syrup can make a stronger bubble. Too much can ruin your solution. Pop! Pop! - If you need more just double, triple, or quadruple the ingredients. Pop! Pop! Pop! –Don’t forget what I told you earlier.
If you make your own bubble solution, pretend you’re a scientist, and experiment to make the mix that you like. All solutions use Glycerin but it is expensive. Remember that you can use a light corn syrup (like karo) or even sugar. It is best to make your mix and let it rest for a day.This helps make a stronger bubble. But don’t worry. You can use it as soon as you make it.
Store your mix in a tightly sealed container. Pour your solution into a shallow tray or bowl for dipping your wand. Make sure it is a little bigger than the wand you are going to use.
Make sure your wand can soak up some solution for better bubbles. If you make a smooth wire wand, wrap it in cloth so it can suck up the solution. Blow or move the wand through the air gently. You can catch or bounce bubbles if you are careful. They usually pop from dust, dirt, or grease. So wear a light pair of gloves and go on a bubble hunt. Don’t shake or stir your bubble solution too much when blowing bubbles. Minerals or other additives in water can affect your 
solution.It is recommended to use distilled water or boil your water for several minutes and let it cool before using.(Don’t forget to have an adult boil the water).
HAVE FUN!
Basic Bubble Solutions Pop! Pour 1/4 cup liquid dish soap into a mixing bowl.
Add 3/4 cup of water. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar into the mixture. (Glycerin or light corn syrup can be substituted). Gently stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves.
Pop! Pop! Add 1/2 cup of water to your mixing bowl. Mix in 2 tablespoons of liquid dish soap.Stir in 1 tablespoons of light corn syrup.(Glycerin or sugar can be substituted).Pop! Pop! Pop! Dissolve 1/2 cup of soap powder into 1 cup of warm water. Mix in 2 tablespoons of sugar, light syrup, or Glycerin. Remember – Don’t throw out your solution if it doesn’t work with a wand. Make Bubble-Falls. Take your solution outside and using a straw blow into the solution. Have fun with the millions of bubbles.
Basic Wands Be creative and use your imagination. Anything that holds the solution across it can be used as a wand. The bigger the wand – the bigger the bubble – the harder it is to blow. Try some things around the house. A slotted mixing spoon.A small strainer. Make one Bend a pipe cleaner (chenille craft stem) into any shape and attach another for the handle. Have an adult bend a coat hanger into a circle (or any shape). Cover it with cloth for best results.
Take 2 straws and thread yarn through them. Make sure the knot is in one of the straws. Using the straws as handles dip the yarn into the solution. Gently remove it and move it through the air. It’s hard to do but when you get a bubble, it will be a GIANT BUBBLE.

I was out she would prepare their new home. Off I went.
There were so many that they were easy to catch.I filled the bowl and ran home.

My fish didn’t have tails, their legs were bigger, and they didn’t look like 
the little black fish I had caught earlier in the Spring.
That day, when I returned home from school, is when I yelled out, “I found a frog on my bed.”
“Surprise,” yelled mom. “You watched a miracle right before your eyes. A fish 
changed into a frog.
Off I went.",I FOUND A FROG,,4-12
22,"On a beach by a tree, sat my family and me.
Then shouted a hog, ""There's a Dog On A Log!!""
A Dog On A Log? Well, how can that be?
He must be saving that big, frightening flea.
Now why would a dog be saving a flea?
Especially in the water on the branch of a tree. 
I couldn't believe what I saw happen next.
Even that Dog On A Log was perplexed.
 
The flea pulled on a rope and up came a boat.
I'll bet you can't guess what happened next.
A flea family ran from the dog's little toe.
They got into the boat and began to row.
Once on the shore, they ran through the sand.
Over a cookie in my left hand.
Right to the hog, that's where they went.
 
They found a new home with an unpleasant scent.
As for the Dog, he's still riding that log.
As for me-Ouch-I think I have a flea.",A DOG ON A LOG,,0-7
23,"Jennie and Jimmy were twins and were they excited. They had just completed Kindergarten. And because they did so well, were going to the Big Zoo in the city.
After they got into the family car’s back seat, mom checked their seat belts and dad said,“If everyone is ready let the journey begin.”They were off and headed to the Big Zoo in the city.
The Big Zoo in the city was a long way from home. It wasn’t long before Jennie and Jimmy were bored. They were so excited and just wanted to see the animals, even get some peanuts, popcorn, and soda. But it was taking so long.
“Are we there yet?” asked Jimmy. “No” his mom replied. “It will be a little while. Why don’t you and Jennie look out the window and count pine trees?”
Jimmy looked at Jennie and then tried to look out the window. But they were too low in the seat to see anything.
Jennie grumbled, “Dad, we can’t see out the window. Are we there yet?”
“Yah, are we there yet,” Jimmy sang out.
“We are getting close.” Mom chimed in. “Why don’t you both sing a song? That will help pass the time.” “Okay.” Jennie said. Then she leaned over to Jimmy and whispered something in his ear. They both smiled and giggled a little as they faced the front of the car and began to sing.
“Are we there yet…. Are we there yet….Arewethereyet, Arewethereyet….
Are we, we, there, there, yet….Are we there yet… Are we there yet……”
Their dad looked at their mom and said softly, “I don’t know about you but I am glad we’re here.”Then in a deep voice he sang out “Weee Haaave Ah-rived!”
Jennie and Jimmy giggled.
Jimmy and Jennie had such a fun day. They visited every animal, had fun in the petting zoo, and ate hot dogs, popcorn, and peanuts. Soon it was time to leave. Mom got their seat belts on and they were headed home.
“I hope they are tired and fall asleep,” dad whispered to mom. “Are we there yet?” Jennie giggled in a soft voice.",ARE WE THERE YET?,,4-12

26,"Arrgh, me hearties, I has a story for ye, a story of untold riches and a young lad who found ‘em. And who am I, ye ask? Well - I be the spirit of Sand-dollar, a pirate and buccaneer, Captain of the Seahorse, the finest ship to ever sail the seven seas.
Ah, she was a fine vessel. Three masts and ten sails made her fast, and her sleek hull let her cut through the waves with ease. Me crew was the finest bunch of  sailors to ever set sail on the open seas. They came from all over the world, to serve on the Seahorse, and share in the riches.
I remember we just hid the treasure and I found a safe place to hide me treasure map. A familiar place, a place, where as a young lad, before the sea called me to service, was me home. As we finished burying the treasure, we saw a storm approaching from the East. It was a bad one. The wind was a howling, rain soaked us to our very bones, thunder roared, and the lightening frightened the bravest of me crew. We were in the longboat, just about to board the Seahorse, when it happened. 
The bottom of the sea opened and the waters began draining. The waters started going round and round. Slowly at first, and then picking up speed until we were in a whirlpool. It didn’t take long for the swirling waters to suck the Seahorse to the bottom of the sea. As for us in the longboat, we watched her go down as we spiraled around that whirlpool before getting sucked down with her.
Arrgh! It makes me heart happy to see that lad growing like he is. They call him Sandy, after me. Ya see I’m his Great-Great-Great-Grandpa.” “Sandy,” called his mom from the house. “You forgot you chores for the day. Remember you were going to clean the attic.”
“Oh,” grumbled Sandy as he slowly walked to the house. “I don’t mind chores, but cleaning the attic! There hasn’t been anyone up there in years.” 
“It must be dark, dirty, and full of spiders and other creepy things. There is probably even a ghost or two living up there with the spiders.” 
“I unlocked the door to the attic,” his mom said. “Be careful, it’s a little dark and there is a lot of stuff just lying around or stacked in piles.”
The spirit of Sand-dollar thought to himself as he watched Sandy. “Arrgh, I must have looked the same on that stormy night when I hid me treasure map in that very room. I wonder if it will be finally found.” 
“This isn’t so bad,” Sandy said to himself. “There’s a lot of neat stuff up here. I’ll clean as I move and organize all these different things.” “Arrgh,” Sand-dollar thought to himself. “That lad be a hard worker. I’d have him on me crew if I could. He’s only been up here a few hours and he’s almost done.”
“One last thing to clean and move,” Sandy said aloud. (Even though he knew, no one was there to hear him). “I’ll just wipe down this old trunk 
and slide it over there in the corner. Wow! This thing is heavy; I think I’ll have to empty it before I can get it to move.”
“Arrgh,” Sand-dollar thought to himself. “The lad be getting close to me map. He has emptied a lot of things from the trunk.”
“Oh, wow!” Sandy said. “Look at this old book. I’ll just open it up and …… a map! Here’s an old map. A treasure map! I don’t believe it! I’ve got to show mom.” 
“Arrgh, the lad found me map. At last, someone can find me treasure and be rich beyond belief.” Sand-dollar said.
“Where did you find it?” his dad asked. “It was in this old book. I couldn’t move this old trunk in the attic so I started taking things out when I saw the book. When I opened the book, the map fell out.” Sandy replied.
Sandy’s mom added. “It’s certainly old and it’s definitely a treasure map.
 And look here, whatever it leads to is buried on our property.”
“Look at this note on the side,” his dad, said. “It says the finder will have untold wealth and be rich beyond belief. It’s signed by someone named Sand-dollar.” “Let’s study the map. Tomorrow morning we are going on a treasure hunt,” his dad said. “Yippee!” Sandy exclaimed. “Arrgh, it appears me treasure is close to being found.” Sand-dollar said.
“Sandy, you take the shovel, mom can read the map, and I’ll use the compass,” his dad said as they walked into the yard to begin their treasure hunt. “Arrgh, look at em go. They be pretty good at following me map. That’s it! 22 paces due West from the well,Turn to the North East and take 6 paces, then 11 paces to the South ….. They be at me treasure.” 
Sand-dollar said.
“If we followed the map correctly, and there really is a treasure, we are standing on top of it,” Sandy’s dad said. “I get to dig,” Sandy said excitedly as he removed the first scoop of many from the sandy soil.
“Arrgh, that lad be a chip-off-the-old-block. Look at him dig. You are almost there lad. Don’t give up!” Sand-dollar said. “I hit something,” screamed Sandy. “It’s a box. It’s the treasure! We found the treasure! Let me get it out and hand it to you dad.”
“An old Book?” Sandy said with disappointment. “ I was expecting to find diamonds, rubies, and gold coins. Not an old book.”
“Arrgh, me lad. Don’t ye give up now. Ye has to look into the old Book lad.” Sand-dollar said. Sandy said. “Mom, let me see the Book. For some strange reasonI want to look through it.”
“This is really interesting,” Sandy said. “And look at this. Different words are circled in the first page. Wow! There is a family tree and a letter written in the back.” “Let me see,” his mom said. “Oh my! Look at this. Here is a branch labeled ‘Sandy’ and above it is written ‘Sand-dollar’ with a 1 circled.”
Sandy’s dad asked, “Could I see the Book?
When I was a little boy, younger than you Sandy,my father told me we had a pirate in the family.
Let me have a few minutes to study this.”“After reading everything, here is whatI figured out.” Sandy’s dad saidin a soft voice.
“Sand-dollar was a pirate. He was also yourGreat-Great-Great-Grandfather.
He left for adventures on the high seas,became a pirate, and, well, the familyjust forgot about him. He wrote his story in this Book and hid it as atreasure. 
“This Book taught him, how to hide the treasure. As instructed in the book, he took all the treasure the gold, silver,the jewels, and buried them.
He asks that whoever finds this othertreasure share it, do good, and do whatthe Book says. “Wow,” said Sandy.“Quite a story,” Sandy’s mom said.
“Arrgh, it does me heart good to seeme family helping me,” Sand-dollar said. “I am digging as fast as I can, mom.”Sandy said. I hit something big!” “Arrgh, that’s it lad. Dig outthat chest. Come on! You and your dad can get it out of thehole. Come on lad, put ye back into it. Push! That’s
it, now pry it open.” Sand-dollar said. “Oh my goodness,” Sandy’s mom said indisbelief. “Look at that. A real treasure.”
“Arrgh, and now lad it’s up to ye to do the right thing.” Sand-dollar said.
“It’s up to you son,” his dad said. “It’s your treasure.” Sandy simply said. “I want two things. The Book, so I can learn whatmy Great-Great-Great-Grandfatherlearned, and that gold sand dollar to help me rememberhim. Mom should have that jeweled necklace.It would look nice on her.
Dad, you need to take some of the gold and sell it tohelp pay some of the bills.”
“I think we should give the rest to the local charity. They know who the needy are,and I think it will help many people for a long, long time.”“I think you are making a wise decision Sandy,”his mom said. “What dad?” Sandy asked.
“I didn’t say anything, Sandy,” his dad replied. Sandy then said, “I thought I heard you say‘I thank ye lad’.”",PIRATES COVE,,4-12
27,"Many years ago, deep in the North Woods, lived a great bear named Paw-Paw. 
He was the strongest and bravest bear 
alive and respected by all the forest creatures. 
One day, all the animals gathered together to discuss some changes in the woods. 
A new animal that walked on two legs and was 
covered in strange fur was making its home nearby. They needed a leader and could think of no one better than Paw-Paw. 
They all marched to Paw-Paws’ cave and asked if he would be the king of the forest. 
Paw-Paw was thrilled and even though 
he didn’t know what being a king was all about, he gladly accepted. 
Paw-Paw then said “I will need some helpers and I want Crowly Crow and Willard Weasel to be my advisors.”
Well, Crowly and Willard were honored,
and both agreed to work with King Paw-Paw. 
One day, Slither, the snake visited King Paw-Paw and told him of a strange animal he saw close by. Paw-Paw asked, “Where did you see this animal?”Slither replied.“It lives with the strange, two- legged creature 
at the edge of our woods.”
Paw-Paw thought for a moment and said. “Willard and Crowly - go to the edge of the woods and see what this animal is.” Within moments, his two helpers were on their way.
In a short while, they were at the edge of the woods watching the strange animal. King Paw-Paw said,“ Willard, go to the animal and ask what he is and why there is a rope tied around his neck.” Without hesitation, Willard scampered across the field and hid behind some piled wood close to the strange animal.
“Psst!” said Willard.The strange animal looked around. “Psst! I am over here behind the woodpile,” Willard said in a louder voice. The strange animal stretched the rope as far as it would go but not being able to see who was speaking said, “Please come out so that I can see you. My master isn’t around.”
Willard came out slowly from behind the woodpile and cautiously approached the strange animal. “What type of an animal are you?” asked Willard. “I am a dog. And my name is Dillard.” He replied. “And what are you?” he then asked. “Me … I am Willard, the Weasel representing King Paw-Paw, ruler of the forest.”
“Why are you bound to that stake in the ground?” asked Willard. “My master keeps me tied so I cannot go into the woods,” replied Dillard. “No animal should be tied,” Willard shouted. “I shall bite through the rope to set you free. You can then come into the woods and live with me.”
As the summer passed, King Paw-Paw fattened himself on berries and salmon,Dillard and Willard became good friends.
One day, Willard sniffed the air. Oh, what a marvelous smell was being carried on the breeze. “Chicken eggs … Fresh chicken eggs,” Willard thought to himself. “I must find them and have a snack.” In seconds, he was off running through the woods and following his nose to his favorite treat.
His nose lead him to the strange creature’s house, where he had first met Dillard. He looked around … All was clear. He followed the wonderful smell of eggs into a strange cave. He looked around and couldn’t believe his eyes. There were chicken eggs, hundreds of chicken eggs all around him.
As he reached for an egg, a chicken saw him and sounded the alarm. Soon all the chickens were clucking, squawking, and making a fuss. 
Then he heard something behind him. As he turned, he saw the strange creature that lived there. The one that Dillard called master. There was no escape and Willard was terrified.
The strange creature looked at Willard and said, “You varmint! You are the weasel that set Dillard free. Why I ought to …” But before he could finish 
Willard yelled out. “Wait! Don’t do anything to me.” “I can return Dillard to you.Just let me pass and Dillard will be back in a very short time.”
The strange creature stepped aside and let Willard free.
When Willard returned to the woods, he ran to his friend. “Dillard! Quick follow me. I need your help.” Well, Dillard didn’t hesitate to help his friend and off they ran- with Willard in the lead.
As they crossed the field, Dillard stopped. “What’s wrong?” asked Willard. 
“My master lives there and I am afraid to go any further.” Dillard replied.“ Don’t worry,” said Willard. “Your master is not there.” Again, Dillard followed Willard 
right into the cave with all the chickens.
In a flash, the master had a rope around Dillard’s neck. He then looked at the weasel, tossed him an egg, and said “Thank you for returning my dog.”
Willard left for the woods without saying a word. Dillard remained with the farmer, making sure no weasel or any other varmint ever bothered his livestock.",THE WAY OF THE WOODS,,4-12

29,"Bill is on a bullying spree. He believes that he is the strongest animal on the farm and that gives him the right to do as he pleases. But the farm animals decide to stop him in his tracks by …………….. a great tale that moves at a quick pace, keeping the reader engrossed right to the end.
Farmer Fred had just bought a new bull. He named him Bill. Bill was a strong and handsome bull with great horns. He was very big for his age. Farmer Fred got Bill, the bull loaded into the trailer, and headed back home to his farm. When they arrived, Farmer Fred said, “Bill, welcome to your new home.” Bill just snorted and tossed his head back to show off his impressive horns.
This was all new to Bill as he was raised in a small stall and his new home was very different. He had a lot to explore. Bill stood on the hill and watched all the barnyard animals. He thought to himself. “I am the biggest animal on Farmer Fred’s farm. No other animal has such great horns.”
Bill chuckled at the chickens as he slowly walked up to them. They were so small and they didn’t have horns.  As Bill approached, the chickens clucked. The lone duck, ducked, as Bill almost stepped on her.
Bill lowered his head and quickly shook it from side to side right in front of the chickens. “I’m Bill, the bull and I’m bigger than you chubby chickens,” he said in a deep voice. “And I am the boss of the barnyard.” Bill, the bull, frightened the chickens. They rapidly ran, flipped, flopped and, flew, to the safety of their cozy coupe. This made Bill, the bull, laugh loudly. He was having fun.
This frightened many of the pigs and they proceeded to their pen for protection.
The biggest pig, named Pork Chop, walked up to Bill and said. “You are a very mean bull, Bill.” Bill snorted a reply. “Well, you have a big, flat nose, a tornado tail and pink ears. Also, you are dirty, and smelly” Then Bill lowered his head, snorted a great snort,and shook his horns at Pork Chop.
Pork Chop was a wise old pig and knew what Bill was doing. He wouldn’t be bullied by any bull, even Bill. Now, Bill, the bullying bull, was expecting Pork Chop to mush through the mud and proceed to the pen for protection. But Pork Chop just stood there looking at him. Then Pork Chop said in a soft voice. 
“You are a very mean bull, Bill,” and walked away
Then, Bill saw some sheep in the meadow. Bill began to walk across the big barnyard towards them. When he got there, he was met by the Roger Ram, the leader of the flock.“I’m Roger Ram, rejoicing at meeting my newest neighbor on Farmer Fred’s farm,” he said in a very polite manner. Bill ran at Roger Ram, snorting and shaking his big horns and said, “I am Bill, the bull.I am the boss of the barnyard.”In a split second, Roger Ram, rammed Bill the bullying bull, between his big horns.
Bill, the bullying bull, looked at Roger Ram and said. “All that white curly hair, might give you lots of flair, but you ram like a ewe.” Then Bill backed up, started to paw at the ground with his hefty hooves, snorted seven snorts, shook his horns, lowered his now lumpy head, and…………Roger Ram and the others retreated from the meadow. Bill, the bullying bull, was proud of what he had done.
All the barnyard animals were afraid of Bill. He was either threatening them with his size and big horns or making fun of the way they looked. It was not a pleasant day on Farmer Fred’s farm. “I am going to call him Bully Bill,” 
said Henrietta Hen.
“That’s not nice,” responded Roy Rooster. “It’s being a bully yourself.”
“Well, we will work on something to stop his bullying,” replied Toby Turtle.
Roger Ram said, “I don’t know what we can do? I rammed him and he called me a ewe.”
Dorothy Duck said, “He almost stepped on me with those heavy hooves. No one is safe!” With tears in her eyes, little Patty Piglet said, “I heard, I was going to be eaten by Farmer Fred. I’m scared.” Pork Chop said in a soft and soothing tone, “Don’t worry my friends. By the evening feed by Farmer Fred, Bill, the bullying bull, will become our buddy.”
Bill was having so much fun. He certainly was the boss of the barnyard.
He looked around and saw a big barn, with open doors, and he just had to let whoever lived there know that he was boss of the barnyard. It was a bright sunny day but as Bill walked into the dark barn, he couldn’t see anything. 
This frightened him a little. He turned the corner around the door and … BOOM … he was stopped in mid stride. Bill realized that he had just walked into something really big. So big, it didn’t move when he walked into it.
As Bill’s eyes adjusted to the darkness in the barn, he started to see what had stopped him. He was looking at the chest of some big animal. Bill was scared.
As he looked up, he could see the biggest bull, with the biggest horns, staring down at him. A voice like thunder filled the barn. “I finally get to meet Bill, the boss of the barnyard.”Now Bill didn’t know what to do or what to say. All he could do was look up at this giant and wonder what would happen next. There was silence in the barn for several minutes as Bill just looked up in amazement. Finally, the big bull said something.
“I am Brian Bull and have lived on Farmer Fred’s farm for many, many, years. In all those years, never have the other animals asked me for help.But today, they came to me with the story of a big bull that was bullying them and they asked me to put an end to it. I agreed!” Bill was never, ever, so frightened. Brian could toss him across the barnyard, with little effort, and one push from his head. Brian slowly lowered his head. Bill looked down and began to shake. Brian got closer and whispered into Bill’s ear.“What do you think I should do, Bill? I promised the other animals I would put a stop to your bullying.”
“I have never been so frightened in my life and I know how the other animals must have felt.” Bill began to sob a little.“I now know how it feels to be bullied and you didn’t even really bully me. I have learned my lesson and I will go out and apologize to all the animals and ask them to forgive me
“You don’t have to,” Brian said. “You already have.” As Bill turned around, he saw all the other animals standing in the doorway.
“Here pig-pig-pig, come on chick-chick ….” The animals heard Farmer Fred calling them for the evening feed.",BULLY BILL,,4-12
30,"On a huge mountain, in a big forest, there was a medium sized meadow and a small pond. in this small pond lived terrance, the turtle and his 
two best buddies, sam and sally swan.
Oh, you may think it odd that a turtle and swans were buddies, really true friends, but i assure you – they were. every day the three of them would search the pond for food, swim together and play games, and tell stories on the shore. when it got dark, sam and sally would return to their nest under a large tree and terrance to his den on the shore, by their tree.
One year there was very little rain and the pond began to dry up. The three friends were concerned and talked about what they should do. “We should stay here.” said Terrence. “The rain always comes and the pond has been our home since we were born.” “I don’t think the pond will last.” said Sally.
“I think we need to find a new home.” Said Sam. Then SAM flew away in search of a new pond.
After several days, Sam returned to find the pond almost dry and his friends not doing well at all. “Sam!” Terrance shouted excitedly. 
“We are so glad to see you! The pond is almost dry. Sally is hungry and scared, and my shell is starting to crack. Did you find a new home?”“Yes,” said Sam. “It is beautiful but very far away and I don’t know how you WILL get there.”
The three talked for a long time. Then Terrance said, “I will stay here and dig deep into my den and the two of you, my true friends, fly to your new home.” “No!” shouted Sally. “We will all go.” “There has to be a way.” said Sam. The three sat under the bright sun in silence, thinking of a way to get to the far-away pond.
“I know how to do it!” shouted Terrance. “See that stick?” he said to Sam. 
“Sally and you WILL each take an end in your bill and I will bite it in the middle. Then, you can fly to our new home while I hang onto the stick. 
We can all be together.” Again, the three sat in silence thinking about Terrance’s idea.
“It will work.” said Sally. “I agree.” said Terrance. “Maybe.” said Sam.
Sam looked at Terrance and Sally for a few minutes and said, “Yes, I think it will work but none of us can talk or open our mouths, no matter what! Does everyone understand? does very one agree?” “Yes.” said Sally. “I agree too.” said Terrance. “Terrance,” Sam firmly said. “It is most important that you DO NOT talk or open your mouth. Remember, you can’t fly!”“I understand.” said Terrance.
WITHIN MINUTES, Sally and Sam each had the stick firmly held in their bills. Sam opened his mouth and bit down on the stick. They were off.
Sally Swan and Sam Swan flew side-by-side, separated by a stick, 
with Terrance Turtle hanging in the middle. It was a very strange but funny sight.
As they flew, climbing higher and higher, no one dared talk or open their mouth. Faster and faster, higher and higher, Sally and Sam flew. Terrance was terrified!
As they passed over a town, they could hear the people talking and laughing. “Look up in the sky!” shouted one boy. “What is it?” asked another. As the people looked up, they began to laugh at the strange sight. 
They laughed, whistled, hooted, and hollered at the silly swans carrying a turtle on a stick.
Terrance heard all the noise but couldn’t look down to see what was going on. Ignoring the advice THAT Sam had given, HIM, he opened his mouth to ask him what was happening. Before he could say a word, he was falling 
and looking up at his flying friends.
Oh, don’t worry. Terrance didn’t get hurt. You see they were close enough to their new home so Terrance fell into THE big, deep pond. But not listening to his true friend could have ended IT differentLY FOR HIM.",ERRANCE TURTLE'S NEW HOME,,4-12

Now Abby knew that sometimes her questions did not relate to the subject Miss Pinkerton was teaching the class. But she just could not resist asking. Abby raised her hand. “Yes Abby,” Miss Pinkerton said.
“Is a Zebra black with white stripes or white with black stripes?” asked Abby.
The class burst out laughing but Miss Pinkerton quickly quieted them by putting her fingers to her lips and pretending to zip her mouth closed.
“Actually Abby,” Miss Pinkerton said. “A Zebra is white with black stripes.” 
“I thought so,” said Abby.
“Who would like to start us off with the times 1 table from zero to ten?” 
Miss Pinkerton asked.Abby raised her hand excitedly. This one was easy. 
One times anything equals anything.
“Tristan,  would you please come to the board and write the times 1 table for the class?” Miss Pinkerton said.
Tristan proudly walked to the board and wrote the times 1 table.
1 x 0 = 0 1 x 1 = 1 
1 x 2 = 2 1 x 3 = 3 
1 x 4 = 4 1 x 5 = 5
1 x 6 = 6 1 x 7 = 7 
1 x 8 = 8 1 x 9 = 9 
 1 x 10 = 10
“Excellent,” said Miss Pinkerton. “McKenzie, would you please do the times 2 table for us.” This continued through the times 8 table and the students did a wonderful job. They had obviously studied hard.
Now Abby was worried. She knew that the times 10 table was easy; all you had to do was to put a zero after the first number. But the times 9 table! That was hard. What would she do if Miss Pinkerton called on her? “Abby,” said Miss Pinkerton. “I would like you to show the class the times 9 table.”
Abby didn’t want to. She knew she had not studied but she had to go to the front of the class and do the best she could. She approached the board and wrote the table.
0 x 9 = 1 x 9 = 2 x 9 =
3 x 9 = 4 x 9 = 5 x 9 =
6 x 9 = 7 x 9 = 8 x 9 =
9 x 9 = 10 x 9 =
Abby  looked at what she had written and said to herself. “I know some of the answers like 10 x 9 is 90, 1 x 9 is 9, and 0 x 9 is 0. I will write them down in their equations. She was starting to feel better since she had some correct answers written down.
0 x 9 = 0 1 x 9 = 9 2 x 9 =
3 x 9 = 4 x 9 = 5 x 9 =
6 x 9 = 7 x 9 = 8 x 9 =
9 x 9 = 10 x 9 = 90
Abby thought for a second and decided to count the parts she did not know.
“Let’s see,” she said to herself. “The first one I don’t know is 2 x 9, so I’ll put a 1 next to it. The second one I don’t know is 3 x 9, so I’ll put a 2 next to it. Oh! I think I am in trouble.” She realized that she did not know too many answers. As she thought about each, she wrote the numbers next to the equations she did not know. The times 9 table looked like this.
0 x 9 = 0 1 x 9 = 9
 2 x 9 = 1 
 (First one Abby didn’t know)
 3 x 9 = 2 
 (Second one Abby didn’t know)
 4 x 9 = 3 .
 5 x 9 = 4 .
 6 x 9 = 5 .
 7 x 9 = 6 .
 8 x 9 = 7 .
 9 x 9 = 8 
 (Eighth one Abby didn’t know)
 10 x 9 = 90
There  were many snickers and chuckles from the class but Miss Pinkerton said, “Class-quiet down and let Abby finish. Remember that it is not nice to bully a person by laughing or making fun of them.” Well, Abby was almost in tears. She was just about to give up when she had an idea. Maybe, just maybe, if she checked her table, from the bottom up, she could get some more answers correct. She was not going to give up!
Abby thought to herself. “9 x 9 well that’s the first one I don’t know,” and marked the table as she did before. She then thought “8 x 9 … Oh! I don’t know that one either.” So, she marked the table and it looked like this.
0 x 9 = 0 1 x 9 = 9 2 x 9 = 1 
3 x 9 = 2 4 x 9 = 3 5 x 9 = 4 
 6 x 9 = 5 7 x 9 = 6 8 x 9 = 72 (Second one Abby didn’t know)
9 x 9 = 81
 (First one Abby didn’t know)
10 x 9 = 90
Abby was really nervous but she continued with the rest. She looked at the equation, realized she did not know the answer, and marked it. When she was done, she had completed the table.
0 x 9 = 0 1 x 9 = 9 2 x 9 = 18 
3 x 9 = 27 4 x 9 = 36 5 x 9 = 45 
6 x 9 = 54 7 x 9 = 63 8 x 9 = 72 9 x 9 = 81 10 x 9 = 90
“Excellent work Abby,” Miss Pinkerton said. “Aren’t you glad you asked me how you could remember the Times 9 Table?” Abby had a big smile but knew she had to give up some talk … talk … talk for some study … study … study. 
She remembered Miss Pinkerton telling her that not everything had an easy trick to help you get through the problem. Before taking her seat, Abby asked. “Miss Pinkerton, can an elephant jump?”
Miss Pinkerton just smiled and said “No.”",GABBY ABBY,,4-12
32,"Sammy saw the snake and snuck around its side.
Sally saw the snake and scampered down the path.
The snake saw Sammy...
 and Sally...
and slithered away.
Did you ever wonder how snakes slither?
Well, let me tell you.
I am Slithers, the Snake and here is how we do it.
As you noticed, we don’t have legs but still get around quite well. We actually have 4 ways of moving. And since we don’t have legs we use our tummy scales and muscles to get us around.
Most of you think slithering is the only way we move. It is our most common way and you could think of it as your walking. We push off something like a bump on the ground or a rock to get going. Then we move in a wavy motion using our tummy scales and muscles to pull us along. It is called the Serpentine method but slithering is just fine.
We can hold on to something with our tail portion, even the ground, and spring our front part forward. Then we drop the front part, hang on, and pull our back part along. Maybe this is like your running as we can go pretty fast. It is called the Concertina method but slithering is just fine.
In the sand, mud, or on slippery rocks we move along in a funny way. It is like your hopping. It’s hard to tell you how we do it. It looks like we toss our head forward, but off to the side, not straight ahead. Then the rest of our body follows in a sideways motion. It is called Sidewinding but slithering is just fine.
Sometimes you slowly crawl on your tummy. Well, so do we. When we need to be quiet and move very slowly, we use some of our wide scales on our back part to grip the ground. Then we push straight ahead with the others. It is called the Rectilinear method but slithering is just fine.
People walk, run, hop, and crawl. We snakes serpentine, concertina, sidewind, and rectilinear. And we both get to where we want to go.
Wow! After talking to you about the way we move, I guess it is easier just to say we SLITHER.",DO YOU WONDER HOW SNAKES SLITHER?,,4-12
33,"In the rainforest, next to a wide river, there grew a great banyan tree. 
This tree was ancient and provided a home for the many animals living in the area.
Henrietta Heron had a beautiful nest high atop the Banyan tree. Carl Crayfish lived in tangled roots that entered the river at the waters edge. Sam the Black Snake had made his home under the great trunk of the tree. Marty Mongoose lived nearby. His home wasn’t actually in the Banyan tree but close enough where the tree offered a cooling shade during the hot days and protection from the heavy rains that fell every afternoon.
His home wasn’t actually in the banyan tree but close enough. The tree 
offered a cooling shade during the hot days and protection from the heavy rains that fell every afternoon. Now you must realize that not all animals in the rainforest are friends. They depend on one another for different things, many times for food.
To better understand this let me explain how Henrietta, Carl, Sam, and Marty live within the great Banyan tree.
Henrietta Heron had built her nest by the river so she that would be close 
to the food she usually ate. Her diet consisted of fish, frogs, crayfish, and even snails. She had a great home.
Now Carl Crayfish lived within the rocks and roots of the tree. Carl was really a scavenger. He would eat the pieces of food dropped by other animals and his home offered protection from animals that might snack on him.
Sam the Black Snake made his home under the great Banyan tree as it was close to many things he liked to eat. Sam preferred bird eggs but didn’t hesitate to eat anything he could catch, except maybe whole crayfish as they were very hard to swallow.
 
Can you guess what Marty Mongoose liked to eat? Well if you said snakes, then you are absolutely correct. Marty liked to eat snakes of all types and sizes.
One day, Henrietta was out looking for food. When she returned to her nest, she found that two of her eggs were gone. Oh, how sad she was! Something had gotten into her nest and eaten two of her precious eggs.
She flew back down to the river so no other birds would see her crying. Then she saw Marty and said to him, “Sam must have slithered into my nest and eaten two of my eggs.” “That is a shame,” Marty replied in a sad voice. 
“Oh, what can I do?” Henrietta asked.
Now Marty knew that Henrietta, and the other herons, liked to eat crayfish 
and, if there were an easy meal to be had, he was very interested. “So, you would like to get rid of that bothersome snake?” he asked Henrietta. “Oh, yes!” Henrietta sighed. “I wish something would eat him.”
“Henrietta, I can help you,” Marty said excitedly. “You and your heron friends need to catch all the fish and crayfish in the area. Break them into pieces and leave a trail of food from Sam’s den to my home. He will be busy eating the food and he will not realize that he is close to me. He will be an easy meal for me and you will be rid of his egg stealing ways.” 
Henrietta thought for a minute, smiled, and then flew off to talk with the other herons. Soon the herons had captured all the fish, crayfish (even poor Carl) and made the trail of food between the snake’s den and the home of the mongoose. Then they returned to their nests to watch.
As Sam slithered out of his den, he was surprised to see all the fresh snacks just lying on the ground. “Yummy! Yummy!” he thought to himself as he began eating. 
It wasn’t long before Sam had eaten his way to Marty’s home. As Sam opened his mouth to eat the last snack, Marty jumped out of from 
the bushes. Well, I don’t have to tell you what happened because you 
already know. But in case you don’t, there was a big B-U-R-P and 
Marty returned home.
 
“Did you see that?” Henrietta asked the other herons. “Now our eggs are safe.”
The other herons saw Marty climbing the tree but it was too late 
to warn Henrietta. All they could do was leave their nests and, like the snakes, find a safer home.
Now Marty was alone. There was no food in the area, and no reason for him to stay in his nice home, protected by the great banyan tree.
The great banyan tree is now empty of all life. But there is a circle-of-life in the rainforest and it won’t be long before new animals arrive at the banyan tree, and call it “home”.",MARTY MONGOOSE,,4-12
34,"As Buzz the Buzzard began to grow, he became more and more curious. Soon his curiosity lead him away from home to a strange new place, a place without the love of his family. It didn’t take Buzz long to realize what he was missing and what he really wanted.
“Welcome stranger. I’m Buzz the Buzzard.You must be here for some advice. But I have to tell you- the old water hole has dried up, there’s no fast food restaurants, and the closest hotel is 100 miles due South. Now, how can I be of assistance?
Ah, I understand. You’re just waiting for the Red Rock Tour Bus. Then you saw me, and decided to have a closer look. Well, while you are here, let me give you some advice. It’s free!
There is nothing more important than your family. That’s it. 
Oh, I guess I could add that friends could be considered your family. Your family doesn’t just have to be your mom and dad, or step-parents, or brother, or sisters or cousins, aunts and uncles. Well, you get the idea. Your family is all the people who love you and all those you love.
What’s that, little one? How do I know? Well, it is a long and sad story but I will make it short since I see your bus coming down the road.
Not long ago, the sky around these parts was full of Buzzards. Yep, my family. One day I decided that living out here just wasn’t enough. 
I wanted to go to the big city.
Now my family begged me to stay. They told me how much they loved me, how much they needed me, they reminded me of all the good times. But I didn’t listen.
Off to the big city I went.
But it wasn’t long before I knew that I had made a mistake.
No one loved me in the big city. I had no family and I was all alone.
But I was lucky because I could just flap my wings and head back home.
Back home to my family. And that’s just what I did.
I don’t know what happened but when I got home there was no one to greet me. No family, no friends, just empty space.
Oh, I see your bus is here so go on, get along, but remember - there is nothing more important than your family.” 
The bus pulled up, came to a stop, the doors opened, and Buzz‘s family stepped out carrying souvenirs from the big city.

35,"Early one spring day, Sally Sue and her mommy planted a small 
vegetable garden. 
Sally Sue planted all her favorite vegetables. She planted carrots, corn, lettuce and even pumpkins.
Sally Sue watered the garden every day and with her mommy’s help, removed the weeds. She was so excited to watch her vegetables grow and her mommy was so proud of her.
The plants grew and grew. One day Sally Sue noticed that the plants 
didn’t look good. They had brown spots on their leaves and it looked like something was eating them.
Sally Sue’s mommy said that it looked like there were little bugs called aphids eating her vegetable plants. Sally Sue was sad. But her mommy told her not to worry. In a few days there would be some hero bugs coming to the rescue.
The next day, when Sally Sue went to the garden, she saw pretty, little beetles all over. They were red with black dots on their back. Her mommy saw that Sally Sue was afraid that these bugs would also eat her vegetable plants, so she yelled out “The heroes are here. Three cheers for the Ladybugs.”
“Ladybugs?” Sally Sue asked. “You mean the heroes are girls?” Then she asked, “Where are the boy bugs?” Her mommy then explained that there were both girl and boy beetles and that they were just called Ladybugs. “Then why are they called Ladybugs?” Sally Sue asked.
Her mommy then explained that when she was little, her grandfather had told her that since they were pretty, and all little ladies are pretty, just like you Sally Sue, they became known as Ladybugs. “Oh” said Sally Sue. “That’s it?” “I was also told that many years ago, in the middle ages, the farmers crops were being eaten by aphids and they prayed to Mother Nature for help.”
“In the next few days, these beetles came and ate the aphids, saving their crops. In respect for their prayers being answered by Mother Nature, they named them Beetle of the Lady. In time they became known as Lady Beetles and later just Ladybugs” “It doesn’t really matter.” said Sally Sue. “They are pretty and helpful, and with due respect to the “boys”… thank you ladies!”
Later that summer, Sally Sue had lots of yummy vegetables. And in early fall, the biggest pumpkins she ever saw.",DO YOU WONDER HOW THE LADYBUG GOT ITS NAME?,,4-12
36,"Ashley ,the Rabbit has three new friends!  They are Sophie, Josh and Tom.  Today she is playing with Sophie in the garden behind Sophie’s house.
“Are you dry today, Ashley?” asks Sophie.  She is making a joke about the day Ashley fell in the pond in the park.  “Yes, I am dry today,” smiles Ashley.  “Thank you for helping me to get out of the pond.”
Sophie and Ashley are sitting under a big tree at the back of the garden.  Plop!  Something falls down from the tree.  “What was that?” asks Ashley.  “I don’t know,” answers Sophie.
Plop!  Plop!  It happens again two times!  “Look at this,” says Sophie.  Ashley moves closer to Sophie.  Sophie is pointing at something.  Ashley looks at it.  It’s a banana peel!
They look around the ground.  They find two more banana peels.  Plop!  It’s another banana peel.   But this time it drops down right on top of Sophie’s head.  Yuk!
Sophie and Ashley hear someone laughing.  They look up into the tree and what do they see?  It’s a monkey.  It’s a very naughty monkey.  It’s Baba, the Monkey!
“Hey, you, up there!” says Sophie. “What are you doing?” But Baba does not answer; 
he only laughs. Plop! He drops another 
banana peel. This time it drops 
on Ashley’s head!
Sophie and Ashley are not happy. This is a very naughty monkey. Why is he dropping banana peels down to the ground? Why is he dropping 
banana peels on top of their heads?
“You come down here right now!” says Ashley. “Yes,” says Sophie. “You must help us clean up this mess.” But Baba just laughs. Now 
he starts to swing from branch to branch. Oops!
He misses a branch.  He falls to the ground.  Plop!  But this time it’s not a banana peel.  This time it’s a naughty monkey.  He’s not moving.  Oh, no!  Is Baba hurt?
Sophie and Ashley are scared They are not happy about the banana peels. But they don’t want Baba 
to be hurt They run over to see if Baba is okay 
He is on his back. They look down at him.
He jumps up and laughs and runs around in circles.  He is not hurt  He was just pretending to be hurt  He runs and jumps and does cartwheels and somersaults. 
Sophie and Ashley laugh at Baba.  He is a naughty monkey, but he is also a very funny monkey.   “My name is Baba!” he says as he runs around.  “I’m Sophie and this is Ashley,” says Sophie.
Sophie and Ashley start to run around with Baba. Now they try to chase him, but he is too fast. He runs around the tree and they follow him. He looks behind him and does not see 
the banana peel on the ground.
Baba slips on the banana peel.  His feet go way up into the air.  Plop!  He lands on his back again.  This time Sophie and Ashley sit on top of Baba.  He can’t move now!
Why are you sitting on top of me? shouts Baba.  Let me go!  Let me go!  We can’t let you go until you answer a question. says Ashley.  Yes, says Sophie.  Why do you drop banana peels?
“I don’t know,” laughs Baba. “I don’t know what to do with the peels after I eat the bananas.” “But this is not good,” 
says Sophie. “We don’t want banana peels in our garden.”
“You’re right,” says Baba.  “I’m sorry.  I made a mess and now I must clean it up.”  So Baba starts to pick up banana peels.  There are many banana peels, so Sophie and Ashley help Baba.
Now the garden is clean.  “Thank you for helping to pick up banana peels,” says Sophie.  “Let’s  have a snack.  What do you want to eat?”  “How about a banana split?” says Baba.",THE NAUGHTY MONKEY,,4-12
37,"There’s a mouse in the house and I saw him today. He ran across the floor as I started to play. There’s a mouse in the house; now, how can that be?.
He stood on the table right by the TV. There’s a mouse in the house and I named him Ned. Since I gave him a name, he sleeps in my bed.  “Hey mom,” Gretchen shouted from her room. “I just wrote a great poem.”
“Really?” her mom replied. “How nice. I always knew you would follow in your father’s footsteps. He was a published author before the accident and I know you miss him as much, if not more, than I. Let me read it and I’ll give you my honest opinion.” Gretchen’s mom read the poem, smiled, and in an extremely sincere voice said “Gretchen, it is a very cute poem. The rhyme is nice, it tells a funny story, and it makes the reader want more. It is very good.”  “You’re just saying that,” Gretchen said. “No!” Her mom replied. “It is very good. In fact, why don’t you write some more?”
“Okay,” Gretchen said. “After dinner I’ll add some more.”

He stood on the table, right by the TV. There’s a mouse in the house and I named him Ned. Since I gave him a name he sleeps in my bed.  Now I feed him all day and he eats like a pig. He especially likes cheese and even dances a jig. He gets into the flower and into the rice. He even opens the cabinet and gets into the spice. What’s that, that I see? There’s not one but two! Ned’s on the counter and there’s another in my shoe. Gretchen took the poem to her mom and asked her to review it again. “Excellent!” she exclaimed. “You are very creative. In fact keep going and maybe Mr Smythe, your father’s publisher, will give you some pointers. It couldn’t hurt to submit it to him.”
The next day after school Gretchen finished her chores and went back to writing.  There’s a mouse in the house and I saw him today. He ran across the floor as I started to play.

Someone help me to shut the mouse gate.
Gretchen again took the poem to her Mom and asked for her opinion. Her mom read it and smiled. “It really is good,” she said. “Why don’t you do one more stanza?” “Sure,” Gretchen said. “It’s really fun and a famous poet has to start somewhere.” Gretchen went back to her room and read the poem several times and after a while she began to write the final stanza.

They’re all over the house, oh how can that be? We have mice in our chairs and mice in our towels. We have mice everywhere and guess who they follow? 
That Ned all he does is look at me and smile. He brought his whole family to live with us awhile. Several days later, Gretchen and her mom met with Mr. Smythe. He was extremely pleased with her writing and told them that he couldn’t promise anything, but that he would talk to some people.
Several days later Mr. Smythe visited Gretchen. He explained to her that very seldom does a new poet or author get her first work published. He watched Gretchen and the way she reacted to the news. She looked at him and thanked him for all he had done.She was sad but she understood. If she wanted to be a poet she would have to do a lot of writing and eventually, she would be published.
“Mr. Smythe,” Gretchen said. “I hope you understand that this is just the beginning and that you can expect me to be submitting many more poems in the future.If you will excuse me I am going to my room to do some more writing.

38,"My name is Allie Kay and I would like to tell you about my first pet.
However, before I can, you have to understand that I am a little older than you are and have a family of my own. Oh! Don’t worry. I am not going to talk to you like a big person. I am going to let my imagination take me back in time to when I was 7 years old. The best part is that I don’t have to try to remember everything. All I have to do is open my journal and read. If you are a girl, or a boy, and don’t have a journal to write down all the special things, get one. As you grow you can read it and your imagination will magically send you back in time. Ah! There is the entry - My First Pet. 
Dear Journal:  This morning I asked my Mom if I could have a pet and she said no. She said that pets make a mess and are a big responsibility.Then she said I wasn’t old enough, or responsible enough, to take care of a pet.
Well, I know I would take good care of a pet. I am so sad. I really, really, 
really want a pet of my own and I can’t have one.
I just got home from school and put my books down when my Mom said, 
“Allie Kay, if you have any homework you had better get it done now. Your brother is spending the night at a friend’s house so I have decided to take you to the carnival.”
I shrieked in excitement and couldn’t help doing my Happy Dance. They were always different. Sometimes I put my hands under my arms,like little wings, and strut like a chicken. Other times I spin around like a great ballerina. Today, for some reason, I put my hands in front of my ears, wiggled them, puffed up my cheeks, and moved around like a fish. “I will do my homework right now, mom.” I said.  Oh! I just couldn’t wait. “I’m goin’ to the carnival, I’m goin’ to the carnival, I’m goin’ to the carnival,” I sang as I did my Happy Dance.
Mom asked me what I wanted to do first. Without hesitating I said, “Cotton Candy. Let’s get Cotton Candy.”  Mom didn’t get any but I got the jumbo size, r
ainbow colored, fluffy, sticky, D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S spun sugar blob on a stick. It was wonderful. Mmm! I can still taste it.
 
“Mom, let’s ride the ferris wheel,” I said excitedly. After a short time in line, it was our turn. We stepped up a few stairs, took our seat, and a man buckled us in.  We were off. I shrieked with excitement as we started going around, higher, and higher. I screamed when we got to the top. It was really high. When we started going down I got a tickle in my stomach. 
It made me laugh.  It was G-R-E-A-T!
 
“Oh, please mom, please,” I said in my saddest voice. Then the nice man looked at my mom and said. “Lady, it is really hard to win so I don’t think you have to worry.”  “Oh, please mom, please,” I said again. Then a strange thing happened. My mom said, “Okay Allie Kay, if you can get the ball in the bowl, in one try, you can have a PET FISH.”
I didn’t know what to say. Mom said I could have a PET FISH.  As I looked at all the fish, and watched others tossing balls at the bowls, I spotted the prettiest goldfish I had ever seen. I just had to have him. I took aim, gently tossed the ball at the bowl, and then tightly closed my eyes. I just could not look.
“We have a winner,” I heard the nice man say.  When I opened my eyes, 
he was holding out the fishbowl and the prettiest goldfish for me to take.
“I am going to name you Moebus,” I said to the fish. (I think I saw him smile). Then I looked at Mom. I didn’t know her face could look so funny. As we were leaving the game, the nice man said. “Remember, don’t feed him too much.”
 
I had MY FIRST PET! When we got home, I told mom not to worry. 
I would be responsible and take very good care of Moebus.
Every day I would feed Moebus and talk to him. I even tried to get him to do tricks. But that didn’t work. After several days, Moebus didn’t look too good. I asked mom what I should do but she didn’t know. She said she never had a pet and that I had said I would be responsible for Moebus.
I was sad and scared. I didn’t want anything bad to happen to Moebus.
“Allie Kay,” mom said. “The man down the street has a fishpond, maybe he can help Moebus.” I picked up the bowl and headed to my neighbor’s house as fast as I could. Mom was right behind me.  I had seen the man many times and knew that his children were grown and had children of their own. But I had never talked to him. I was nervous and a little scared. 
But I rang his doorbell.
“Hi,” I said in a bubbly voice. “My name is Allie Kay and I live down the street.”“Nice to meet you,” he said. “I am Ted but my Grandchildren call me Pop Pop, and you can too. Oh, I see you have a very pretty goldfish. 
What’s his name?” “Moebus,” I replied. Pop Pop continued. “Moebus looks like he needs his water changed, come on out back to my fishpond 
and we will refresh him.”
Pop Pop said. “Allie Kay, you are a very responsible young person.You recognized that Moebus was a little under the weather and got him some help. Others may have just let him live in dirty water, getting sicker, and sicker. You must really love Moebus.”   “Oh! I do,” I said. “Moebus is my first pet.  Will he be alright?”
At that, Pop Pop put Moebus in the fishpond with all the other fish.
I started to say something and Pop Pop said. “Don’t worry. Let’s get Moebus a bigger bowl (I’ll trade you this small one for a big one).” 
How could I refuse? Pop Pop then gave me a big bowl and said go get some gravel, wash it, put it in the bowl, and fill the bowl with water. I did and by the time I was done, Pop Pop had Moebus in a net and ready for his new home. My mom and I thanked Pop Pop and as we were leaving, he said two things. To me - “Remember to change his water every three days and if you need help please ask.”  To my mom – “You must be proud to have  such a responsible and caring pet owner as your daughter.”
As mom and I stood by the table and watched Moebus swimming in his new home, she gave me a hug and said, “I am glad you got your first pet.”",MY FIRST PET,,4-12
39,"Sophie and Ashley have a new friend.  His name is Baba, the Monkey.  Sometimes he can be very naughty.  But he is really a very nice monkey.  Today, he meets two new friends.
Sophie walks with Baba down the street towards Josh’s house.  Well, Sophie is walking.  But Baba does not walk.  He likes to run and jump and do cartwheels down the pavement.
Sophie knocks on Josh’s front door.  Hmmm! No answer.  “I wonder if Josh is in the garden behind his house.” says Sophie.  Baba is still doing cartwheels on the pavement.
“Come on, Baba.” says Sophie.  She and Baba walk around to the garden behind Josh’s house.  Hmmm! No Josh.  But Sophie hears Josh’s voice.  She looks up; his bedroom window is open.
“Josh!” shouts Sophie.  “Josh!”  For once Baba stops running and jumping and doing cartwheels.  He stands still and looks up at the window.  The voice from Josh’s bedroom stops.
There he is! Josh pops his head out of his bedroom window. “Hi Sophie,” says Josh. “Who is your new friend?” “This is Baba.” answers Sophie. “Do you want to come out and play?”
 
“I can’t,” says Josh.  “I have a problem in my bedroom.”  “What is it?” asks Sophie.  She and Baba both look up at Josh.  “I have an invisible tiger in my room!”
 
“What!” say Sophie and Baba at the same time.  “It’s true,” says Josh.  “Come on up.  The back door is open.”  So Sophie and Baba go through the back door of Josh’s house.  They go upstairs to his bedroom.
 
Sophie knocks on Josh’s bedroom door.  He opens the door and says, “Quick!  Come in fast!”  Sophie and Baba go into Josh’s bedroom and he closes the door quickly.
 
Sophie says, “Josh - this is Baba.  Baba - this is Josh.”  Then she asks, “Why do we have to come in quickly?”“I don’t want the tiger to escape,” answers Josh. 
 
Sophie and Baba look at each other.  Then they start to laugh.  “Josh,” says Sophie.  “Are you sure you’re okay?  There’s no tiger in here.”  Suddenly they hear a roar!
 
“I am Lexa, the Tiger.” says a voice.  Sophie and Baba are scared.  They jump back.  Their mouths and their eyes are wide open.  “See,” says Josh.  “There is a tiger in my bedroom.”
 
“And not just any tiger,” says Lexa.  “I am a special tiger.”  “Why are you special?” asks Baba.  “And how do we know you’re a tiger?” says Sophie.  “We can’t even see you.”
 
“Don’t make her angry!” says Josh.  “She is already in a bad mood.”  Lexa roars again.  Josh and Sophie and Baba all take a step backwards.  They are scared.
 
“So you want to see me?” asks Lexa.  “Watch this!”  And suddenly, there she is, standing in Josh’s bedroom; a very pretty tiger with beautiful stripes.
 
Sophie and Baba and Josh all say, “Wow!”  Lexa is pretty, but she is not happy.  “Why are you in a bad mood?” asks Sophie.  “Because my paw hurts,” answers Lexa.
 
“Let me see,” says Sophie.  Lexa puts out her paw and Sophie holds it.  Sophie looks very closely at Lexa’s paw.  “I think I see the problem,” says Sophie.  “It’s a thorn.
 
“A thorn?” asks Lexa.  “I can help you,” says Sophie.  She has small fingers so she can easily pull out the thorn.  “Is that better now?” asks Sophie.  “Yes,” answers Lexa.  “Thank you so much!”
 
So now there is a new friend on the street.  Sophie and Josh are so excited. They want to show their new friend Lexa to their other friend, Tom.  They hope Lexa does not become invisible again!",THE AMAZING INVISIBLE TIGER,,4-12
40,"“I’m Rose.” “I’m Violet.” “And we are identical twins.” They said at the same time. 
“We look the same,” said Rose. “We sound the same,” said Violet. “We even dress the same,” they said together as they giggled.
“It’s my birthday,” said Rose. “No, it’s my birthday,” said Violet. And both the girls laughed as they yelled, “It’s our birthday.”
Yes, Violet and Rose were identical. They looked the same, dressed the same, talked the same, acted the same, made the same face when they were happy, did the same frown when they were sad, and they even got the same grades in school.
Oh! What’s that? They don’t get the same grades in school? I wonder why. “I can tell you why,” their mom said. “Rose is a little more responsible and pays attention to fine details. 
Violet is a little less responsible and sometimes doesn’t pay attention to things she doesn’t like doing.”
“Come on in, girls,” their mom yelled out the door. “It’s time to open your presents and your dad and I want to see how you like them.” Oh! They were excited. They ran up to the house, up the stairs, through the door,
and into the hall where they saw two big boxes. Their excitement grew as they wondered what was inside. Then they smiled at one another as they each dashed for a box. “I want this one,” yelled Rose. “No! I want that one,” yelled Violet.
“Girls!” Their mom said. “You know it doesn’t make any difference, they are both the same.”
Rose and Violet laughed when they realized how silly they had acted. Of course, the presents would be identical, just like them. They each got a box unwrapped, opened, and then looked inside. Rose happily yelled, “Stuff to make a flower garden. This is great, something I always wanted to do. I can grow my own flower garden.”
Violet said, “I like flowers, and a garden would be nice. But there’s a lot of stuff in this box and it seems like it would be a lot of work.” Violet was right. There was a lot of stuff in the box.
It contained everything they needed to make a flower garden, everything except water, sunshine, and love. Both girls thanked their mom and dad for the great present and they dragged their heavy boxes outside to start their gardens.
They each selected a patch of ground to call her own, took the “How To Garden” book from the box, and began to read. Rose said, “Violet, you were right. This is going to be a lot of work.”
They carefully removed the grass, loosened up the ground, added and mixed in the special flower soil, and planted their flower seeds. Violet found some nice sticks and pretty ribbon to make a fence around her garden. She gave the seeds their first watering and said, “Rose, I am going inside to watch television.”
Rose asked her Dad to help her make a stone fence around her garden.
“A very special garden needs a very special fence,” she said to him as they gathered and placed the stones. After some time the fence was completed and Rose gave the seeds their first watering.
“Well, maybe later. Right now I want to eat breakfast, and then I think I’ll play a game.” Violet said. Every morning Rose tended her garden and every morning Violet had something else to do. Every morning Rose would remind Violet to water her garden and Violet would reply, “Let Mother Nature take care of it.”
One morning Rose checked on her garden and she couldn’t believe what she saw. Her garden was covered with little flower plants. She was so excited she danced with joy. Then she looked at Violets garden. It didn’t have many plants, but there were some.
Rose opened her “How To Garden” book to see what she should do next. “Hmm,” she said to herself. “I must thin the plants. I need to take some out to make room for the others to grow.” Rose felt bad. She loved her flowers and now had to pull some out of the ground. Then she had an idea.
I’ll plant the ones I pull from my garden into Violets. And that is exactly what she did. Rose then gave both gardens a big drink of water. She loved her garden and there was no reason she shouldn’t love her sister’s equally.
Their mom watched from the kitchen window. She was very proud of the way Rose was helping her sister. Rose was looking at her garden when she heard Violet coming out the door. “Wow!” Violet said when she saw her garden. “Look at all those plants Rose. I have just as many as you. Our gardens are really growing.” “Violet,” Rose said. “Do you know that I …” And she stopped talking for a second, as she was angry. She continued. “Do you know that I think our gardens are growing equally?”
“I think so too,” Violet replied. “And from now on I’m going to tend my garden every day, just like you.” Over the next several weeks they watered their gardens, pulled the unwanted weeds and grass, fed the plants, and even got some worms to put in their gardens to keep the soil loose. Just like the “How To Garden” book recommended. They were pleased. The plants were growing and many had buds that we re ready to open.
Oh! It wouldn’t be long now. It wouldn’t be long before there were two beautiful flower gardens. The girls were so excited. They just couldn’t wait to see all the colorful flowers. The next morning they got dressed and hurried outside to tend their gardens. To their surprise, they were in full bloom. They shrieked with excitement, held hands, and danced in circles. The flowers were so beautiful. 
Every color in the rainbow was in their gardens.
“We have a surprise for you! You are going to have a baby brother soon. And your dad and I know you will take care of him as well as you take care of your gardens. Aren’t you girls excited?” Rose and Violet just stood there. They didn’t know what to say. All these years they were a family of four, and now there was going to be a strange fifth member. Another member that would need his parent’s love. Love that should be theirs, and they did not know if they wanted to share.
“What’s wrong, girls?” their dad asked. “Your mom and I thought you would be happy and excited. Let’s have a glass of milk and maybe a cookie or two. Then you can tell us why the frowns.” As all four were licking the center from their cream filled cookie, Violet spoke up. “You are going to love me less because you are going to have to give him love.” “I feel the same way,” said Rose. “I don’t want you to love me less.”
 “My goodness,” their mom said. “We could never love either of you less. Where did you get that idea?” “It’s not an idea,” Rose said. “There are two of us and two pieces of love, one from you, and one from dad. When there are three of us, you’re both going to take some of that love away from us, and give it to him.”
“Oh, girls.” Their dad said. “Love isn’t shared. Love is magical and it grows.
 Why each day your mom and I love you more than the day before, and tomorrow we will love you more than we do today.”
 
“Rose, do you remember the morning you went out to your garden to thin the plants?” she asked. “And how you saw that Violets garden had just a few?” “And do you remember what you did?” Rose thought for a minute then said. “Yes, I remember taking my flower plants and putting them in Violet’s garden so she would think her garden was doing as well as mine.” Violet just looked at her sister.
Her mom then asked. “Why did you do that?” “Well,” said Rose. “I love the plants and I love my sister so I thought I would share the plants with her.”
“Ah,” said her mom. “Share the plants. That must mean that you loved your plants less because you gave some to Violet.” Rose thought about what her mom had said, then replied. “No, I didn’t love my plants any less.”
“I loved them the same and I loved the ones in Violet’s garden, and I loved doing something nice for her, and I loved watching both gardens grow, and I love the flowers in both gardens, and I love you. Now I understand how magical love is, and how it grows.” “Me too,” said Violet. “Let’s go out and smell the flowers.” “I’d love to,” said Rose.",THE FLOWER GARDEN,,4-12

42,"Once upon a time, there lived a monkey who had no home of his own. They called him ‘Springs’, for he always walked with a bounce in his steps.
He had sold everything he owned, and with that money, he had started traveling the world. 
He wanted to see the world’s smallest and biggest wonders. He traveled from village to village, town to town, 
and offered his services- to do work in exchange for food and shelter. 
He was a happy monkey and he loved helping people.
One day, he passed through the village of Zver, where twenty animals lived. He saw an old beaver. so he walked towards him and said “Hello, Mr. beaver. If I was to do some garden work for you today, would you be so kind as to give me something to eat.”
The old beaver agreed and asked Springs to do some gardening and fix up a few things around the house. It was a long and tiring day for Springs but enjoyed his day. 
When springs returned to the house in the evening, the whole village had gathered there. There was a lot of food put out on the large wooden table and everybody was celebrating as though a hero had come to their small village.
They all had a great time that night; it was like a big party. There was dancing and lots food and Springs really enjoyed his evening.
The following morning when Springs was ready to leave, the old beaver approached Springs with tears in his eyes and said, “Thank you for joining us for dinner. Please come back whenever you have time. I have two boys around your age who I have not seen in 10 years. Spending time with you reminded me of my boys.”
Springs did not know what to say so he just hugged the Beaver, just like he would his father, and set off on his way with a promise to return one day.
Springs had been walking for some time and was tired. 
He saw two highway robbers who pushed him down and took his bag away. 
When the robbers looked in his bag they only found a rope, some tools, and some bread. 
They threw his bag on the ground and ran away. Springs picked up his backpack and continued on his journey. 
He started to think about all the good and bad in the world. 
The road was long and winding and finally led him to a dark forest. The only way he could continue his journey was to walk through the forest. 
Springs walked for more than an hour and then he realised he was lost. He decided to climb up a tree to relax and eat some of the bread the villagers had given him. Suddenly Springs heard some voices shouting for help. 
He climbed down from the tree and ran in the direction the voices were coming from. Springs reached the place the voices were coming from. 
Springs reached the place the voices were coming from. He saw that the two robbers who had pushed him earlier that day were trapped inside a deep hole in the ground. 
They were both trapped and couldn’t get out, and were yelling for help.
Springs quickly reached into his backpack and grabbed the rope that was inside. He tied one end of the rope to a tree and threw the other end inside the hole. The robbers both quickly climbed up the rope to safety. 
The robbers were amazed that Springs had saved them. One robber asked “Why did you help us? We pushed you and tried to rob you earlier!”.
Springs replied “There are good people and bad people in this world. The good people do good things and bad people do bad things. I have decided to be one of the good people.” The two robbers were amazed by Springs’ reply.
Springs told the robbers, “I have traveled far and wide, seen happiness as well as sorrow. I have met all kinds of people; good, bad, old, and young. I have experienced all sorts of bad things, but I have always tried to do only good things.”
 
As Springs was leaving, he gave the two robbers some bread with a smile and said, “I hope what I have said today will help you realize that there is always a way to live without causing harm to others.”",THE HOMELESS MONKEY,,4-12
43,"“Hi! My name is Samantha and I want to be a scientist. You may be wondering why and my answer is simple. I am amazed at all the wonderful things like television, cellular phones, men on the Moon, space exploration, and the list goes on. But those are big things and I just don’t understand everything about them yet. I also wonder about smaller things like-why do my doll’s eyes close when I lay her down and open when I pick her up. Or how are cartoons made? Hmm – I know it has something to do with Science. My brother Samuel wants to be a scientist too, but he likes things that I don’t, like-why Stalactites grow.
But even though we don’t like the same things it’s still Science so we get along just fine. In fact, our teachers help us better understand Math, technology, current events and trends - all of which are important. We even help each other and have lots of fun.
I like to experiment or take things apart to see how they work. No matter what I do, I tell my mom or dad what I am going to be doing and sometimes even ask for their help. I would never just do something. I could get hurt.  Sometimes it’s best to start small, and that’s just what I did. I remember my first experiment in detail and it was a lot of fun to do. I had to do an optical illusion. You may be wondering why that is important and all I can say is that it’s the basis for making 
cartoons - and here is why. Our brains fill in the gaps for whatever our eyes aren’t processing. So two different pictures can actually become one or still images can appear to be moving.Try this experiment, it’s lots of fun and there is nothing dangerous about it. Here is what you need:
• 2 small pieces of white cardboard or index cards.  • Tape  • A pencil to be used as a shaft • Crayons, colored pencils or whatever you want to draw with
The Experiment Preparation: • Draw a large birdcage on one piece of cardboard. You are the scientist so make it look like you want. Just make it pretty big.
• On the other piece of cardboard draw a bird. Maybe a Budgie or a Toucan. Just make sure it is  smaller than the birdcage.
• Tape the pictures, back-to-back, onto the pencil shaft. The Expected Result:
• What do you think is going to happen if you spin the pencil? I can’t tell you because I did it and this is your discovery.
The Experiment: • Hold the pencil between the palms of your hands. • Rub your hands to make the picture spin around. • Of course, you have to look at the picture while it’s spinning.The Experiment Result:• You should have seen the two pictures appear as one. If you didn’t see the bird in the cage, keep 
 trying until you do.
That is Science! Have some fun and try different pictures.(I even put Samuel in jail once). Hey, do you want to do a little magic and make a spot on a piece of paper disappear? It’s different for each person but it does disappear. Yes, it’s Science too but let’s get to the experiment and I’ll explain the Science later.
It’s simple to set-up. Just draw a square about ¼ inch to one side of a white piece of paper and color it in. Draw a circle about 3 to 4 inches to the right that’s about the same size as the square and color it in. This is the dot you are going to make disappear. Actually you can draw two small pictures, or letters, or numbers, or whatever you want. One of them will disappear.
• After you draw them hold the paper at arm’s length.
• Close your left eye and focus on the square with your right eye.
• Slowly move the paper towards you.
• At some point the dot will disappear.
• Try it again and make the square disappear. 
 Close your right eye and focus on the dot with 
 your left eye. Move the paper towards 
 you until the square disappears.
It’s magic! Well, actually it is Science. You see, the spot where your optic nerve connects to your eye doesn’t have any photoreceptors. That means it is a blind spot and we all have them.
You never notice this blind spot because your two eyes work together to cover it up. Just like in the first experiment your brain fills in for the blind spot with the background.
I have a question for you. What do you think will happen if you use a colored piece of paper like red? 
If you don’t know, do another experiment and see for yourself.
Science is fun and I am glad I am going to be a scientist.
Maybe you’ll decide to be one too.”","SAMATHA, THE GIRL SCIENTIST",,4-12
44,"“Hi! My name is Samuel and I want to be a scientist. You may be wondering why and my answer is simple. I am amazed at all the wonderful things like rockets to the Moon, fire trucks pumping out all that water, fast race cars, space ships, and the list goes on. But those are big things and I just don’t understand everything about them yet.
I also wonder about small things like-how does sugar turn into crystals called rock candy? Or how are those rock formations in caves made? Hmm – I know it has something to do with Science.
My sister Samantha wants to be a scientist too, but she likes things that I don’t-like why her dolls eyes open and close. But even though we don’t like the same things, it’s still Science so we get along just fine. In fact, our teachers help us better understand Math,
technology, current events and trends - all of which are important. We even help each other and have lots of fun.
I like to experiment or take things apart to see how they work. No matter what I do, I tell my mom or dad what I am going to be doing and sometimes even ask for their help. I would never just do something – I could get hurt.
Sometimes it’s best to start small, that’s what I did. I remember my first experiment in detail and it was a lot of fun to do. It had to do with growing small crystals, much like the way rock candy is made. You may be wondering why that is important and all I can say is that it’s the basis for making any type of crystal. Their shape and size depends on many things and the more you read about them, the more you experiment, the more you grow interesting crystals. 
Try this experiment; I call it The Crystal Bowl. It’s lots of fun and there is nothing dangerous about it. Because I am using a common chemical I let my mom know what I am doing.
Here is what you need:
• A small clear bowl to grow the crystals in
• Epsom salt (a common chemical)
• Food coloring
• A measuring cup
The Experiment :In the clear bowl, stir ½ cup of Epsom salts with ½ cup of very hot tap water. The hotter, the better.
Stir for at least 1 minute. You will be making a saturated solution (scientific talk)-meaning that the water cannot hold any more of the Epsom salts. Some undissolved salt crystals will be at the bottom of the bowl.
Add a couple of drops of your favorite food coloring. I like red.
Place the bowl in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. I put a sign on the bowl – Samantha-Do Not Eat! (I’m so funny.)
Take out your bowl of crystals and pour out the extra water that may be at the bottom. Have fun examining them.
Okay, it’s time to get Scientific. What just happened? You just made Magnesium sulfate crystals. Magnesium sulfate is the actual name for Epsom salt. 
The temperature of the water determines just how much Magnesium sulfate it can hold. The hotter the water, the more it can hold, and the more crystals it can grow.
 
So why did we put it in the refrigerator? By rapidly cooling the water we forced fast crystal growth. The quickly cooling water became denser and made the Magnesium sulfate atoms run into each other joining together into crystal structures. 
When you grow crystals this way they will be small, thin, and a lot of them. If you let the water evaporate slowly you will get different crystals. You will have to experiment to see the results.
That is Science! Oh, don’t forget to clean up any mess and ask your mom or dad to really clean anything you might reuse.
Have you ever seen those really neat formations in a cave? They are commonly called stalactites (they grow from the top of the cave down) and stalagmites (that grow from the cave floor up).
Want to make some? I’ll bet you do!
Again there is nothing dangerous, but let your mom or dad know what you are doing. This experiment takes some time and could get a little messy.
Here is what you need:
• Two glass jars
• A large plate or pan
• Baking soda
• String
• Paper clips
• Water
The Experiment : Fill the two jars with hot water. The hotter, the better.
Stir in as much baking soda as will dissolve in the water. Mix it up well and make that saturated solution.
Cut the string so it can go close to the bottom of the jars and go between them when they are several inches apart. Then tie a paper clip to each end to act as weights.
Put one end of the weighted string into each of the jars.
Place the jars on the large plate or pan, making sure the string has a little dip in the center. The plate or pan is needed to catch the drips of your scientific solution.
Put your experiment in a safe place for 3 to 4 weeks. Keep an eye on it and watch your formation grow.
What has happened? The saturated solution is carried through the string. This process is called capillary action.
When it gets to the dip in the string it drips onto the plate or pan. It is similar to water passing through the ground, picking up minerals, and falling through a cave. Over time the dripping water evaporates and creates stalactites and stalagmites.
It’s magic! Well, actually it is Science and takes place all over the world.

47,"Hi! My name is Mathew. That’s Math_ _ as is mathematics and _ _ _ _ ew as in you are going to learn some multiplication tricks.
Before I share the new tricks let’s just review some other things to remember when multiplying.
Remember 0 times anything is always equal to 0.
2 X 0 = 0
Now it’s your turn, quick! What is 4 X 0?
That’s right it’s 0, good job
Remember 1 times anything is always equal to the “anything.”
1 X 6 = 6
Now it’s your turn, quick! What is 1 X 9?
Great work, you are correct it’s 9.
And of course you remember that 10 times anything is the “anything” with a 0 added at the end.
10 X 3 = 30
What is 10 X 5?
That’s right. It is 50.
Now here is a trick you can use to help you with the Times 9 multiplication table for 9 x 0 through 9 x 10.
First write down the table:
9 X 0 = 
9 X 1 =
9 X 2 =
9 X 3 =
9 X 4 =
9 X 5 =
9 X 6 =
9 X 7 = 
9 X 8 = 
9 X 9 = 
10 X 9 =
Next complete the table with the easy answers for Times 0, 1, and 10.
9 X 0 = 0 (0 times anything always equals 0).
9 X 1 = 9 (1 times anything always equals the anything).
9 X 2 =
9 X 3 =
9 X 4 =
9 X 5 =
9 X 6 =
9 X 7 = 
9 X 8 = 
9 X 9 = 
10 X 9 = 90 (10 times anything equals the anything with 0 added to the end).
Simple enough, right?
Next, pretend you don’t know the answers to 9 X 2 through 9 X 9 and starting at the top (9 X 2) write the numbers 1 through 8 next to each. 
9 X 0 = 0 
9 X 1 = 9 
9 X 2 = 1
9 X 3 = 2
9 X 4 = 3
9 X 5 = 4
9 X 6 = 5
9 X 7 = 6
9 X 8 = 7
9 X 9 = 8
10 X 9 = 90
That was easy. Now do the same thing but start at the bottom (9 x 9).
9 X 0 = 0 
9 X 1 = 9 
9 X 2 = 18
9 X 3 = 27
9 X 4 = 36
9 X 5 = 45
9 X 6 = 54
9 X 7 = 63
9 X 8 = 72
9 X 9 = 81
10 X 9 = 90
Success! You can easily write down the Times 9 multiplication table for 0 through 10.
Times 11 everybody. Yes, that is what I said.
TIMES 11, it’s SCARY! 
Or is it?
First, look at 1-digit numbers multiplied by 11. 
It is much like multiplying by 1 except there are two places in the answer. (One times anything is anything – or in this case anything-anything).
11 X 0 = 0 (Remember, 0 times anything is always 0).
11 X 1 = 11
11 X 2 = 22
11 X 3 = 33
11 X 4 = 44
11 X 5 = 55
11 X 6 = 66
11 X 7 = 77
11 X 8 = 88
11 X 9 = 99
Wow! That was easy. 
But can you easily multiply 2-digit numbers by 11?
Yes – And here is the trick!
These are big numbers but don’t get scared.
Let’s look at 11 X 15.
Take the number you want to multiply by 11 (in this case 15) and imagine a space between the 2-digits.
1 _ 5
Now add the two numbers together.
1 + 5 = 6
If the answer is a single-digit (1, 2, 3, etc.) put the sum in the space to get your answer.
165
So … 11 X 15 = 165
Go ahead and try a few.
11 X 12 =
The answer equals 1 (1+2) 2 or 132.
11 X 26 =
The answer equals 2 (2+6) 6 or 286.
11 X 81 =
The answer equals 8 (8+1) 1 or 891.
You didn’t know you were so smart, did you.
Oh-oh … What do you do if the numbers in the space add up to a two-digit number like 10 or 17?
Well it’s a little tricky … But not hard.
Let’s take a look at 11 X 77.
Imagine that space between the 7 and 7.
7 _ 7
Add the two numbers together (7+7=14)
Put the second number into the space (in this case it is 4)
747
Then add the number 1 to the first number.
(7+1)47 … or
Let’s do a little more practice.
The challenge: 11 X 29 =?
2 _ 9
2 (2+9) 9
2 (11) 9
Keep the second space number in the space and add 1 to the first number.
(2+1)19
319
So … 11 X 29 = 319
Let’s do another great big one just for fun.
11 X 98 =?
9 _ 8
9 (9+8) 8
9(17)8
Keep the second space number in the space and add 1 to the first number.
(9+1)78
1078
So … 11 X 98 = 1078
Wow! You catch on fast. With a little practice, you will be able to multiply 2-digit numbers by 11 in your head. Practice and challenge your friends (or maybe your teacher) to a 2-digit times 11 contest.",MY NEW MATH TRICK,,4-12
48,"Meow!! I mean: Hello, I am Clarice the Cat.
I know I don’t look like a regular cat.
It’s not because I’m skinny, and not because I’m fat.
It is because my owner makes me a pretty cat.
 
From dressing me in costumes
and flowery hats
to painting my nails. Can you imagine that!
She always treats me tenderly,
and feeds me twice a day.
Miss Molly is never too busy to sit by me and play.
She makes my pretty costumes from old dolls’ clothes and such.
 
I never know what I’ll be wearing, but I know it will cause a fuss.
Miss Molly is my favorite person,
and as she grows and grows,
I hope she will always be my friend,
and make me all my clothes.
Purr! I mean.
“Good Night!”",CLARICE THE CAT,,0-7
49,"Sophia was excited. She was now in the 2nd grade and it was her first day of school.
As she finished her breakfast, she looked out of the window and saw all her friends waiting for the bus.
“Mommy, can I ride the bus?” she asked. “Yes,” mommy said.Sophia was even more excited.
She jumped up from the table to go to the bus stop. Then her Mommy said, “Yes, you can ride the bus next week but I’ll walk with you to school for the first week.” Sophia was sad and confused. She thought her Mommy said she could ride the bus but then kind of changed the answer.
Sophia wondered why her Mommy just didn’t say “no”.  At least then she wouldn’t have gotten so excited. “Oh well,” Sophia sighed. “Let’s go, it is a long walk.”
Several days later, the music teacher talked with Sophia’s class.
She explained about all the instruments and had the 3rd graders demonstrate each of them.
Sophia heard the flute and thought that it made the prettiest sound she had ever heard. “Can I play the flute?” Sophia asked. “Well, that depends,” replied the music teacher. “First, you need to get your parents’ permission, and then join the band. You also need to know that learning to play the flute, or any instrument, takes a lot of hard work.
Now, if you are willing to put in the work and you parents let you join the band, then the answer is YES. And I would be happy to have you join. We need another good flutist.” Sophia was so excited and couldn’t wait to ask her mommy.
School was over and as Sophia walked out of the door, she saw her mommy waiting. She ran down the sidewalk, yelling out “I want to play the flute. Can I play the flute? I want to join the band.”
“Calm down, Sophia.” her mommy said. Sophia took a deep breath, counted to three, and said, “Can I please play the flute in the school band?”
“Yes, of course you can,” her Mommy replied.              
Oh, Sophia was so very happy. She had gotten permission and was now going to play the flute in the band.
Her Mommy then said, “Yes, you can play an instrument just like I did.
The tuba is a great instrument and you can even have mine. The same one I used when I was in band.”
Oh, poor Sophia, she was so sad. She wanted to play the flute, not the tuba.
Sophia just didn’t understand why her Mommy said “yes” when she asked but really meant “no”. At least “no” for the instrument Sophia really wanted to play.
“Maybe I won’t join the band,” Sophia said in a low, sad voice. “Well, that’s up to you,” her Mommy replied.
As Sophia finished her breakfast, she looked out the window and saw all her friends waiting for the bus. She was so very excited. This was a special day.
The week was up and she could ride the bus with all her friends. She squirmed in her chair as she gulped down the last mouthful of milk.
“Bye mommy!” she squealed as she ran towards the door. “And if I can’t ride the bus, please say NO. It is easier for me to understand.”","LEARNING ABOUT ""NO""",,4-12
