,"Kids, Creative Nonfiction, Sad","Once again, unannounced, the 
have engaged; robbing me of required sleep. They refused to release me, so there I was on the couch with MSNBC buzzing in the background and Daisy curled-up fast asleep at my feet, apparently without a care in the world. There is never any rhyme or reason as to the why or what seeks my attention. Meanwhile, the same scenario repeating itself and with each mental playback becoming more vivid and irritating; refusing to permit me the freedom to return to the sleep I so desperately desired.
 
In silence, I tossed and turned; mumbled and grumbled. Seeking to escape the noise only I could hear.
 
Without engaging in religion, asserting there is or is not a heaven with streets of gold or a hell and its lake of fire, I wish upon my antagonist the fate of spending whatever eternity that might exist, the job of full time, never-ending task of coaching little league baseball
 
Growing up I, from what I have been told, I was the perfect child. Rarely cried, could entertain myself for hours with a pad of paper and pencil, a box of blocks, throw in a deck of cards, engaged for days, never seemed in trouble of any kind, really, I admit I was THE ideal child.
 
I was compliant.
 
I was obedient.
 
I was docile.
 
I was the “perfect” child.
 
These personality characteristics or flaws, whether nature or nurture, stifled my being.
 
Spring of sixth grade, the school principal announced that the local Little League would register boys interested in playing baseball. At this point in my life, I had never been involved in any kind of organized sports program. I recall that somewhere around this time I went to the YMCA every Saturday where I did not learn how to swim, injured no one with the bow and arrow, or BB gun, learned how to remove multiple bottles of soda from the Soda Machine on a single dime, and got to meet Aunt Jemima. She wandered and chatted nonstop while we consumed pancakes covered with syrupy. 
 
Here is where the story gets dark. I felt so intimidated by my parents that in order to ask permission to sign up for Little League; I wrote my mother a note. Basically, Dear Mom, yada, yada, yada, can I join the Little League and play baseball, yada, yada, yada? Sincerely, Michael.
 
Apparently, I felt so alarmed by making such a request, I literally signed the note I was going to give to my mother, seeking permission to play baseball. I expected the answer would be no.
 
Over the years, the 
 replayed this story with gaps perhaps, but the key elements have never changed. The details remain the same and mental pictures are clear. I say this because, as I recall, she seemed surprised that her son would feel the need to write a formal request to join, in this case, the Little League. I can only wonder how she internalized this interaction. 
 
She said yes. And that was her level of engagement, her participation in my Little League experience. She never came to any of my games, never! 
 
My dad, on the other had helped get me registered and attended several of my initial practice sessions. But that was his level of engagement, his participation in my Little League experience. He never came to any of my games, never, okay rarely! And rarer still played catch after work.
 
Now we move on to why this story replays late at night when the house is quiet and the 
 decide to hang out, to keep me awake, to make me angry, feeling robbed, cheated, conned, filled with regrets.
 
I know nothing about the coach, his name, what he looked like, why he wanted to coach, his family, likes or dislikes — zip. I suppose it is cruel on my part to hope that for all eternity; they assign him to coach Little League. But…
 
Okay, as I have freely noted in other stories, I was the little guy, small for my age, almost always the smallest child in class photos, and having never played in organized sports had questionable athletic skills, if any. The only notable skill was I could run faster that the bullies, which, if you are wondering, was a superb skill to possess. 
 
I got myself to all my practices by hopping on my 24-inch Firestone bike, and I can only assume I was compliant at practice sessions following the coaches’ directions and peddled safely home. Then game day, I got myself dressed in my uniform and then to the baseball field, by hopping on my 24-inch Firestone bike, and I can only assume I was compliant at the game following the coaches’ directions and peddled safely home, where I recall my parents never inquired how the game went, did we win or lose? Did I play?
 
I was, and still am, left-handed and the coach informed me that the only position I could play was right field. Cool, that makes me special! With that knowledge, every game checked the lineup, and I got to start every game! In right field! Every game I trotted out to my position, turned around, cheered my teammates on, waiting for someone to hit the ball to right field. It never happened, not once in the entire season! So, without committing an error, trotted back to the bench. 
 
Looking back, I realized how, at every game, scheduled to hit eighth in the lineup. So, being compliant, I waited for my turn to bat. Apparently, we were not an overly talented team because I never got to bat in the first inning! At this point in every game the coach, the adult in charge of this quiet, compliant, undersized wannabe, was told that he must let everyone play and was having another player replace me in right field. 
 
The entire year I only played in the first inning, never had a ball hit my way, and never picked up a bat or stood at home plate, never. Sat on the bench and watched the entire game. Hopped on my bike, peddled home, and placed a perfectly clean uniform in the wash for the next game.
 
During weekly practice sessions I, with a few others, spent our time in the outfield shagging flies tossing them back toward the infield. Occasionally, we would lineup to take a few swings and on the last swing run to first base.
 
Cannot change the past, but yes, I have regrets, disappointments that keep me awake at night while the

I suspect this person is long gone, but not forgotten. He has left a lasting memory, literally.",Voices In My Mind: Baseball Dream
,"Kids, Sad, Creative Nonfiction","The bell rang as the door opened. She could smell how old the post office was. It had been there long before her grandparents were born in that tiny town. It was a comforting smell until now. It had been a familiar smell that wrapped around her tiny body, now, now it was squeezing the breath from her lungs when she realized the newspaper stand was empty. ""No, no no!"" The little girl panicked. Frantically she ran around the post office, tossing envelopes around, hoping an extra would be hiding underneath. She looked under the waste basket, and behind the door. Diving under the table she checked by the baseboards. There was no newspaper anywhere. The clerk started to look up but the girl couldn't let them see the fear in her eyes. Couldn't give them a reason to tell on her. She ran out of the building, terror building in her tiny chest, a scream threatened to follow. What was she going to do? She pulled on her hair. What was she going to do?!
 
The little girl walked home. Biting her fingers on one hand, the other clenched in a fist. Muffled screams echoed around her fingers. She had time before her failure came to light. Time to come up with a cover. Opening the front door she darted up the stairs to do the dishes that she was supposed to do after getting the newspaper. Her little brother was in the hallway making a mess like always. A mess that she always had to clean up. She couldn't take on that burden right now. She screamed at him to clean the mess up before 5 o' clock came and threatened her with its unwanted arrival. ""You need to clean this up right now! I don't want to do it!"" Her little voice came out shrill. Her brother's anger came out. Throwing toys at her, he howled and called her terrible things. Sighing, she ignored the familiar names and made her way to the kitchen.
 
Sighing again she eyed the mountain of dishes that had to be done in an hour. With a slight struggle, she pushed a kitchen chair up to the sink and began running warm water, mixing in dish soap. She watched the bubbles rise and a giggle rose up in her throat. With soapy fingers she popped the bubbles and let the giggles out. The girl temporarily forgot what she was supposed to be doing and instead entered a fantasy world. But just as soon as she entered the imagination world, fear reared its ugly head. Her small heart lurched and she doubled down on her chore. Each dish got scrubbed once, then again, then again, they had to be perfect. They had to be squeaky clean. They had to pass. 
 
The girl looked at the clock, she was running a little behind on her chores. She hurried and dried the dishes, making sure they were all dry before stuffing them in their respective places in the cupboards and drawers. Then as fast as her little body could, she tidied the kitchen until she thought it would pass. 
 
Skirting her brother, she dashed into her room and began cleaning it. Until she came across one of her favorite books. It begged her to open it. ""I can't, I have to clean this up."" But she hesitated, just for a minute right? She plopped down, ignoring the screaming inside her head to finish what she had to before 5 o' clock came round. ""This will only take a minute, I love the pretty pictures, and look how fun this world looks!"" The rational voice in her little brain, the voice that shouldn't have existed yet yelled at her again. But the call of her imagination was winning. Her inner child covered the mouth of the ugly rational voice, watching the little girl be a little girl, even if it was only for a minute.
 
 The girl got lost in the magical world of unicorns and princesses. Of hero's and dragons. She stroked the beautifully painted pictures, wishing with all that she had, that she could live there. Live there with the perfect princesses, instead of this place, this hole, this fear. The minutes slid by with every page turned, the fear stamped down by a five year old's rightful imagination. Until she heard tires on the gravel drive way.
 
The terror reared up so fast that it hurt. The fear flooded her veins, freezing them until the blood stopped moving. Throwing the book, the little girl scrambled up and shoved everything under the bed and in the closet. She cursed herself out, why was she so dumb? Why couldn't she just do what she was told? She didn't have time now to clean her room perfectly. She tumbled out into the hallway and shoved her little brothers toys into his room, ignoring his protests. She then ran into the kitchen and started to make a sandwich for the heavy boots. 
 
She heard his booted steps on the stairs and flinched when the door swung open. Her little brother's eyes grew huge, fearful and he toddled to his room. She hunched down, trying to make herself smaller, hoping to take up less space. 
 
""Do you have my newspaper?"" The little girl's heart plummeted so far down she didn't think it would come back up into its place behind her ribs. She forgot to come up with a good excuse, a good cover. She rushed through making his sandwich and placed it on a plate. Slowly turning she looked up at him and blurted out, ""I couldn't find the one you wanted."" His face turned red. ""How could they not have it? It's the damn post office, they always have a newspaper."" The little girl flinched, almost dropping the plate. ""At least you have my sandwich ready."" He grabbed the plate from her. ""Wait this doesn't have any lettuce!"" The anger in his eyes burned into her soul. With a yell, he brought his fist down onto her tiny skull. She cowered down, and tried to fight the tears that threatened to escape. Crying only made it worse. ""Why can't you do anything right? Why are you so stupid?"" He walked past her and plopped into his chair. She hurried behind and took off his boots and went and hid in her room. She kept the door cracked, just in case he yelled for her and she had to come running. Quietly, she cleaned, hoping with all her little heart that he didn't hear her. 
 
After all, daddy always had to be happy, right?
 
 ",Tiny Anxiety
,"Kids, Fiction, Suspense","	I let Mom guide me through our dark, chilly house, moving everywhere she pushes me, passively helping her complete her chores simply by existing. It’s not the first time for this middle-of-the-night gather-and-dash routine, and we move seamlessly from room to room, despite most of the lights being dark. In my bedroom, one of her hands rests on my shoulder as we roll up pajamas, jeans, extra underwear. For some reason she pulls a winter coat from my closet, even though it’s May and New Jersey isn’t all that cold in May. We shove things into backpacks and move like quiet, unwelcome ghosts in our own home until we reach the front door and an explosion stops us.
	Shattered glass somewhere behind us.
	It’s a loud splintering that makes my whole body jump.
	My father’s rage fills the entire, dark space of the house the way smoke once filled our kitchen when Mom burnt corn muffins to blackened mounds.
	Only that had made us all laugh.
           Just as Mom pushes me the last few feet towards the door, and as she slides on her boots, I catch my reflection in the tilted mirror by the bathroom. Slack faced, emotionless. I look like a ghost. Only for a second, I wonder if the reflection is actually mine. Is 
 what I really look like on nights like this?
	The girl in the glass seems older, somehow more aware of herself than I, like she sees me and knows something I do not. Behind her looms a dark shadow. It shifts just a bit even though I know 
 didn’t move. I whip around but I have no shadow. It’s too dark. When I turn back and try to straighten the mirror, I’m swept out the front door, and the stronger girl vanishes from sight.
	Only the shell of me is left.
	Every time this happens, it’s like I become more and more transparent. I’m invisible and Dad becomes much--sharper. It’s as though he literally can’t see me when he’s drinking, unless he needs something from me, like a bucket for his vomit. Otherwise, I cease to exist, completely gone from his view. It has to be true because what dad can see his daughter, and then proceed to smash her favorite glass dolphin figure against the wall? That’s what happened one of the last times we left in the middle of the night. This time he seems more focused on punishing the kitchen, Mom’s bowls and vases. But I know by now not to expect anything I love to be intact when I return. The only choice is to stay smart, move quick, and accept it. This is just the way things are.
	It’s better to not be attached to anything. Not even myself.
           As Mom opens the car door for me, I see my tired reflection again in the dusty window, the same dark circled eyes, no shadow this time. Only frowning. Me. I guess that’s what acceptance looks like. Every time we have to leave while Dad “cools down”, which most often means breaking dishes, ripping pages out of books and smashing Mom’s houseplants, I have to accept it. I have no idea why cooling down means taking it out on every object in the house, but apparently that’s what it takes for Dad to come to his own acceptance and back to us.
	Fight, smash, leave, treatment, apologize. Wash, rinse, repeat.
	“Lydia, sweetheart. Get in the car and fasten your belt,” Mom breaks me out of my trance. Her voice sounds exactly the way she speaks to her students at the glass studio where she works. Calm, calculated, always even-toned and so trustworthy. She can never get Dad to calm down before he explodes, but with me, and with her students, she’s like a still pond. No ripples, no disturbance. Almost as though nothing out of the ordinary is even happening.
	It’s kind of confusing, honestly.
           I climb into the backseat of the old Camry we call Georgie for some reason, throw my backpack across to the other side with a loud 
, and put on my seat belt. Even though the drive will only take us around the corner, Mom plugs in her phone to play music. Some cheery Broadway musical, like she always listens to drown out Dad’s screaming about money or countless other things I can never even make sense of. I rather have silence, but I don’t say anything as Mom starts to back up the car.
	I never say anything.
	“Everything’s going to be okay, Lyds. Okay?” Mom says, staring at me through the rearview mirror like her gaze alone will convince me. I look back at her tired eyes, but I know by now how empty those words are despite how much she wants them to be true. She really, really wants them to be true, no matter how many times Dad proves her wrong. But I nod so she’d just 
 already.
           Mom puts the car in gear, and I turn around in my seat to look back at our dark house. It’s a nice yellow, a little faded, but looks a bit like a farmhouse as it’s one of the older homes in town. Paint curls up in spots, but it’s not falling down or anything like most haunted-looking houses. Dad’s family owned it for decades and apparently it used to be a pretty popular historical home that people toured and everything. But in the last several years, I don’t think my parents so much as cleaned out a gutter. Yet it’s still the kind of place you might see on the cover of a home improvement magazine, with no real clue of what goes on inside. But with all those peaks and eaves and dirty, odd-shaped windows it looks a little haunted to my friends, especially at night with no lights on. The perfect trick or treat house. If only a real monster wasn’t hiding inside. I never invite people over.
	I’ve lived here all my life; this is maybe the tenth time we’ve had to leave because of Dad’s drinking. I lost count. But it wasn’t always like this. I remember laughing and board game nights and Dad teaching me how to play rummy. Back then it only happened once in while, it was easier to think Mom’s favorite phrase was true, that it would all be okay. But lately, it’s every few months. It’s like the house doesn’t really belong to me and Mom at all because of this, it really is all his, 
 haunts it and when he wants it all to himself, he gets it. All he has to do is scream or break something or punch a hole in the wall, and out we run. It makes me more than a little bit mad. And afraid. And being afraid of someone you love is the strangest combination. It makes no sense and it’s not fair. Because I do love my dad, and he sometimes has good days.
	But this isn’t one of them.
           Mom pulls out of the driveway, and makes the left turn toward my best friend Jill’s house. Jill’s mom is my mom’s best friend, so that’s usually where we go. That part is actually fun, if I’m being honest. It’s way better than Mom’s other friend outside town where we stayed once when Jill had family visiting and no room for us. That time Mom said I could have the couch, but I wanted to curl up in this beautiful, white lambswool covered chair that looked like I’d be sleeping on a cloud. I was smaller then, I’d fit. In the middle of the night, while Mom snored, I woke up in a serious fit of itching only to find fleas covering my arms and legs. I had red, itchy bites for weeks and we never stayed there again.
	But at Jilly’s, we watch movies and I sleep over in her room on the little trundle bed, and Mom gets the whole apartment over their garage. It’s like a second home and sometimes I wish we all really did live together like this all the time. Jill’s house is always warm and smells of coffee and popcorn and there’s a 
 of laughter. Her mom makes hot chocolate on cold afternoons and Mickey Mouse pancakes for breakfast just for the heck of it, and her dad doesn’t even exist—Jill and her sister Avery were born without a dad. I mean, a guy exists somewhere, but Mari said she never planned to get married, but she always wanted to be a mom. So she had Jilly and Avery on her own. I don’t totally know all the details, but I’m really glad Mari decided the world needed a Jilly. Because I know I certainly do.
	Sometimes I wonder what it must be like to not have a dad at all. Much quieter, I imagine. Not that I
 would want my dad to 
 exist, only not be so mad all the time. Maybe have a snowball fight with me like we did when I was little. Or teach me guitar like he’s always promised but still hasn’t even tried. It would be okay if he just made hot chocolate once in a while. But right now, all I can imagine is him inside the house, stomping like a monster from room to room looking for more things to break.
	Eventually there will be nothing left.
           I glance up at my bedroom window and the attic window just above that. Right before the house is completely out of view I see a bright flicker of light. No one ever goes up in the dirty attic. It’s full of Dad’s family’s crap, as Mom says. She so badly wants to throw everything away and make the attic a library. But he’s never let anyone touch it and yet he never goes up there either. Plus it’s freezing in winter, sweltering in summer, so we just keep it closed up as though it doesn’t exist. A void in the ceiling.
	The black hole above our heads.
	The door to the attic steps is actually in my bedroom and I keep it blocked with my desk because the drafts in the house frequently make the door rattle in the frame in the middle of the night. But maybe Dad pushed it aside to run up there and maybe he’s trying to signal us to stop? Maybe he realized how hard he grabbed Mom this time and he wanted to say sorry for making her fall.
	“Mom, stop!” I shout. She slams on the breaks and immediately pulls over out of surprise.
           “Lyd, please. My nerves can’t take anymore shouting right now.”
           I don’t apologize and only lean toward the back window to try to get a better look. “Just wait one sec,” I plead.
	 Sure enough, even in the shadows it’s clear someone has their hand pressed against the glass in the little arched window, but it’s a small hand. Not my dad’s. I squint. It looks like a girl. Like a girl maybe my age wearing a blue and red striped shirt. Goosebumps pop up all over my arms and the back of my neck.
	I unbuckle, jump out of the car--despite Mom’s protests--and run a little way back toward the house.
	“Lydia!”
	But I can’t answer her back or explain what I’m doing because I don’t even totally understand what I’m seeing. My mouth feels dry and my jaw frozen in place.
	She looks a lot like me. Not just a shadow.
           “What are you doing?” Mom pulls me by the arm back to the car, breaking my gaze. “What are you even looking at?” She glances back at the house, with a confused look on her face, but it’s obvious she doesn’t see anything.
           I pull out of her grasp to look one last time and my heart sinks. This time all I see is a dark, empty window. As I crawl back into the car, I don’t tell her I’d hoped it was Dad, but instead I saw a girl—a 
 girl—in our attic.
	Because ghosts don’t exist.
	And there’s no hope for Dad.  
 
 ",Free as a Ghost
,"Creative Nonfiction, Kids, Crime","Emily didn’t like going to Mass with her Mum every Sunday. It lasted too long – sometimes over an hour – and it was in Latin, which she didn’t understand. So, when her Mum took her to another church with a shorter service, in English, things started to look up, not least because there was a shop at the back of the church. Though she was only nine, she was a sucker for retail therapy, even if the items on sale only consisted of holy water, statues of saints, rosary beads, prayer books and holy pictures.
	Brother Eugene was the friar who ran the shop at the back of the church. You pronounce it 
he said.
	‘Is that a French name? Are you French?’ Emily asked him.
	Yes. No. 
	‘Why are you called Brother Eugene? Do you have a brother? Or a sister?’
	‘Emily, don’t be nosey!’ her mother chided.
	‘We are all brothers here.’
Emily was stunned into silence. It must be a very big family, she thought. Eugene was one of the younger monks. He had wavy dark hair, a beard and kind, friendly eyes with a genuine smile. She liked him, and so did her mum. Every week after mass they visited the shop and Brother Eugene gave her a free holy picture. Sometimes he gave her boiled sweets, too, which he fished out from the depths of his tunic pocket. She liked the acid drops best, but her mum said she was not to ask for them, it was bad manners. Soon Emily had amassed an impressive collection of holy pictures which she stuck on her bedroom wall in alphabetical order. Normally she wasn’t allowed to stick anything on her wall, but holy pictures were different. Her mum approved of anything to do with Jesus, Mary and the saints.
	The Fundamentalist Friars were an order which embraced modesty and simple living. Their aim was to address the ills and divisions in society. Emily liked the monks’ outfits: brown woollen habits with long pointy hoods and thick white cords tied around the waist. To her fertile imagination they looked like wizards, and she like to imagine them flying up on broomsticks to chat with the angels. But their habits looked very itchy. Did they wear anything soft underneath, Emily wondered? She couldn’t bear wool next to her skin – it made her scratch until her skin was red and sore. She had heard that sometimes very holy people wore uncomfortable clothes as a penance for their sins. Was that instead of or as well as going to confession? Emily hated going to confession. She used to lie awake the nights before, thinking about the hard, wooden church pews, hearing the sounds of every throat-clearing and nose blowing of the dwindling line of penitents and - most of all – dreading the sins she would have to confess. The goosebumps it gave her made her arms look like the skin of a plucked chicken. 
	 Surely the Fundamentalist Friars didn’t commit sins?
	On her tenth birthday, Brother Eugene gave Emily a birthday card. 
	‘To a dear little girl who is ten years old today, with much love, Br Eugene.’ 
	It wasn’t a holy card, as she expected; there was a picture of a pony on the front. He knew she loved ponies. He also gave her a plastic glow-in-the-dark Virgin Mary miniature grotto. Emily was delighted. She displayed the card and grotto on her bedside cabinet with pride. 
	The next Sunday, Brother Eugene asked her mother if he could treat Emily to a trip to the cinema to see the latest hit movie, 
. 
	Her mum said yes. 
	It was June, and the sun beat down on them as they stepped off the underground train, fighting against the tide of shoppers on their way to the city centre, dodging and weaving between prams and pushchairs, groups of teenagers with tunnel vision, old ladies dragging oversized shopping trolleys, elderly men shuffling along, bent over with the evidence of a life of hard manual labour in the docks. This once-salubrious city was now in decline. Rubbish littered the streets, handsome merchants’ houses stood empty like towers of Lego, and clusters of unemployed men hung around on street corners waiting for the betting shops to open. When your whole life is in the hands of the gods, why not put the odds of a win in the hands of the gods, too? 
	Brother Eugene had bought a family-sized pack of fruit pastilles – her favourite – to scoff while they were in the cinema. She grabbed Eugene’s hand and skipped alongside him, blissfully blind to the broken dreams and desolation that surrounded them. The progeny of a middle-class family and privately educated, she had been sheltered from the disparity between her life and have-nots in her city, victims of a declining shipping industry and the fallout of World War Two, and the lrish immigrants who had escaped the desperate poverty of their country of birth only to be met with signs saying ‘No Irish’ on the doors of terraced slums that were little better than the homes they had escaped.
	
 had just been released, and there was a long queue outside the cinema. 
	 Emily was sitting behind a tall man, so she had to lean to one side to get a better view. It didn’t occur to her to ask Eugene to swap places. It brought Emily so close to him that she could see his Adam’s Apple bobbing up and down when he swallowed. She gave an involuntary shiver as a smorgasbord of uneasy feelings began to fill her mind - she couldn’t say why - and the thought of eating fruit pastilles made her nauseous.
	The lights dimmed.
	***
There’s a fine line between treachery and trust.
	Brother Eugene was transferred to another monastery in the Midlands. He told Emily that it was God’s wish, and God always had his reasons. 
	For a while, he still sent Emily birthday cards and presents:
	
	Then the missives stopped. 
	Emily never did find out what his real name was. 
	And she never watched 
 again.
***
 
Postscript
I cannot believe how naiive I was to trust that man. Of course, I had heard rumours of what went on within the Catholic church, but it always seemed to be such a rare occurrence. Catholics are good, Godly people. As a rule.
         Eugene was such a charming, quietly spoken young chap, interesting to talk to and Emily adored him - probably more for the sweets he gave her rather than the holy pictures, but still. I wanted so much for her to develop a strong faith, what with all the temptations out there – boyfriends, drink, drugs – that I was blind to other, far graver, dangers. I thought I was keeping her safe within the caring environment of the church. How could I have agreed to the two of them going to the cinema without me? She could have been murdered. The damage she has suffered is bad enough. She is visiting a specialist counsellor – not alone, of course - so that she can work through the healing process. Then perhaps we will be able to face the legal issues that lie ahead.
	I will never recover from the guilt.  
	***
It’s a shame, but we had to let him go. Eugene was one of our most promising novices. Devout, reliable, with an equable temperament that lent itself to a life of sacrifice – a requirement which many others have found too challenging. What does the future hold for our order?
	I must say there were times when I had my suspicions – he was a generous man, fond of giving gifts from our shop to the younger members of our congregation. Yet because no harm seemed to come of it, I was tempted to overlook his pecadilloes, especially because he was attracting new worshippers in these sadly secular times.
	As head of the order, I have issued an apology and hope that we can now draw a line under the whole distasteful business. I am sure that, given time, Eugene will see the error of his ways and atone for his sins, God willing. So sad.

,"Kids, Fantasy, Middle School","        “Moooooom!” Jack’s screamed as his feet stomped down the hallway past my door. 
	I turned over and took a look at the clock. 
	10:15pm 
	I’ve barely been asleep for a half hour. Rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I heard mom complaining to my little brother, “We already checked. There’s no monster under your bed.”
	“But I felt the blankets! It’s tugging on my blanket. It stole my dino plush too!” 
	“Honey, go back to bed,” mom said, and that was the end of that. 
	Jack shuffled down the hallway, and I saw his shadow stop at my door. Before he could knock, I flung open the door. Jack jumped back, rubbing his wrist nervously and sniffling. “Amy?” 
	“I told you to keep the dino on your bed,” I hissed. “He protects you. Dad told me so.” 
	“I tried,” Jack whined. “That 
stole it when it took my blanket.” 
	I shouldn’t have faulted Jack. For a five-year-old, he was doing well. Dad knew mom would never believe him or us, so she thought this was all in our heads. We’re kids. We make up stories, right? Every kid 
there’s a monster under their bed or in the closet. 
	But dad says only a few people can 
the monsters. 
	I grabbed a flashlight and followed Jack to his room as silently as possible. If mom came out, she’d yell at me for ‘feeding into Jack’s over-active imagination’ or something equally as dumb. 
	Jack’s room was surprisingly clean for a 5-year-old, but it was that or lose toys to 
Dad said he doesn't know what happens to the toys if those things eat them or just collect them like dragons collect shiny jewels and gold in stories. Maybe each monster is different. 
	Making sure not to get too close to the bed, I got down on my hands and knees and turned on the flashlight. Even under Jack’s bed, there were mostly boxes, a couple of stray socks, and a sneaker that looked gnawed at the toe. 
	A patter of feet and a shadow moved past the bed to the dresser. 
	“Fast thing, isn’t it?” I grumbled. “Wish dad wasn’t on a business trip.” 
	I hauled myself up and went over to his closet. I kicked the door closed and wedged the desk chair under the handle. 
	Standing tall, I announced in a loud whisper, “Give back the blanket and dinosaur plush, or I’m bringing reinforcements.” 
	Jack waited at the door, squeezing his hands into tight fists. 
	Another quick patter of feet or hands or something and even a creepy giggle echoed in the room. Jack jumped back, ready to bolt again. 
	“Fine,” I hissed. “You asked for it.” At the door, I handed the flashlight to Jack. “Point it in the room wherever you hear the giggle. He’s in for a world of hurt.” 
	
	I threw open my door and fell hard on the floor, staring under my bed now. Clothes and plushies littered the floor, and some pooled under my bed in a chaotic mess. 
	I waited for the shadow to move. “Hey, we got a problem.” The shadow moved again in response. “Dad’s out of town, remember. Come on. I’ll grab you a few cookies; just take care of whoever’s in Jack-Jack’s room.” 
	It didn’t take long for a response. A specific shadow slithered out from under my bed. He never liked the light, but cookies could coax him into the bright hallway. 
called him Specter. Most of the time, he wasn’t clear. A formless shadow under my bed. He’d only scared me once when I first met him. To any kid, the clawing and scraping sound in the middle of the night would cause nightmares. But dad said he was probably lonely and trying to wake me up to make a friend. 
	I’m not really sure what Specter looks like. He changes, though most of the time, he’s small. A black figure, almost like a cat hiding under my bed. A kind of shapeless cat that wanted cookies and sweets. But he could shift, like now. Specter stood up to the ceiling, ducking the hallway light as his dark form moved down the hallway. Jack moved to the side, gaping at Specter. 
	I touched my finger to my lips, making sure Jack didn’t scream. “Don’t wake mom! Specter will take care of it.” I whispered, then turned back to Jack’s room. “Last chance. Give it back, or Specter here will earn his cookies.” 
	Jack handed me the flashlight again. I wished I could see them more clearly, but dad said it would give me nightmares. 
	Specter rushed to the bed, the dresser bumped, and a few toy dinosaurs fell to the floor. 
	“What’s Specter going to do? Is he going to…?” Jack knew the word but hated saying it. 
	“No, he’s just going to scare him away. I don’t think this one wants to be friends like Specter.” 
	The desk crashed into the wall, so I decided to shut off the hallway light, step inside Jack’s room and close the door. Jack huddled close to me. The closet door slammed shut, and I felt Specter come closer. 
	“Hope mom is still asleep,” I mumbled. 
	“Is it gone?” Jack asked, glancing down at Specter. 
	Specter didn’t really make noise or talk, but he rubbed against Jack’s leg next. 
	“Yeah, I think so. Want to run down and get the cookies? You owe Specter.” 
	Bending down, Jack patted Specter on the head and beamed. “Two for you, two for me?” 
	Specter stood on two legs, stretching towards Jack’s hand belly, and pawed at him, sending Jack into a flurry of giggles. 
	“Ok, three cookies. Be right back!” Jack ran downstairs as I moved around and started picking up the toys that fell. 
	As I passed the closet door, something banged the door. Specter arched his back and started to grow, but the scuttling in the closet faded. 
	I opened the closet and at my feet was Jack’s dinosaur plush and a scrap of Jack’s favorite blanket. Specter came and sniffed at the items, grabbed them, and hopped onto Jack’s bed. 
	“Why don’t you stay the night under Jack’s bed,” I said. “Keep him company. That was pretty scary for him.” 
	Specter hopped off and made himself comfortable under Jack’s bed in the shadows.",Specter
,"Kids, Funny, Adventure","	By the time Gilbert Einstein opened his eyes, the sun had already risen and with it, birds were singing songs to their loved ones. The rustling of leaves accompanied nature’s orchestra and was crescendoed by children’s laughter, and a cloudless sky perfected the scene. 
	For Gilbert, this was icing on the cake, for what made today great wasn’t the weather. It was Saturday. No school, no homework, and best of all, no spelling test. Not wanting to waste a second of his free time, Gilbert jumped out of bed, greeted the poster of his honorary uncle 
sticking his tongue out, and ran downstairs. After a bowl of cereal and a piece of toast, Gilbert charged out the door.
	But it wasn’t the birds or the rustling of the leaves that Gilbert wanted to see. It was his best friend, Sally Green. Two city blocks, a flight of stairs, and a walk down a hallway later, Gilbert found Sally slaving in a kitchen. 
	“Hey, Gee,” Sally chimed out. “Sit down at the table. I want you to enjoy heaven on earth.”
	A minute later, Sally offered Gee a grilled cheese sandwich, and as soon as he took a bite, Sally chirped, “Well, what do you think?”
	Without thinking about what was going to say, Gee replied, “There’s nothing so special about it. Mom’s Cheesy Kid’s Stuff sandwiches are better.”
	Sally was flabbergasted. “Mom’s Cheesy what?”
	“Cheesy Kid’s Stuff is what Mom calls them. They’re grilled cheese sandwiches, but she mixes up several types of cheese and plasters them on two slices of bread, before she cooks them. I tell you, there’s nothing like them.”
	For a moment, Sally pondered over what Gee said, then she went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and pulled out several packages of cheese. “Any of these kinds of cheese look familiar?”
	Gilbert inspected the display and shrugged his shoulders. “I have no idea.”
	A dull clunking sound vibrated through the room as Sally dropped the cheese on the table. “Well, let’s find out.” She grabbed two pairing knives and handed one to Gee. “Gee Einstein, it’s time to slice and dice.”
	For the rest of the morning, Gilbert and Sally were fixed in the kitchen. Gouda, provolone, and mozzarella were in play, but no matter how they tried, they couldn’t match Gilbert’s mother’s recipe. In fact, each time they attempted to do so, it tasted worse than the time before.
	Exasperated, Gilbert cried out, “There’s got to be something missing.”
	Equally disappointed, Sally returned to the frig and searched vigorously. Then, she saw it. Hidden at the back of a shelf, was a green cylindrical container. She grabbed her prize, pulled it out, and showed it to Gee, shouting, “Parmesan cheese!” 
	Armed with the new ingredient, they redoubled their efforts. Again, Gilbert and Sally tried to recreate the secret formula. Though the taste was slightly better than better, they were no closer to solving the mystery.
	Frustrated, Gilbert decided to explore the frig himself. He rummaged through the shelves on the door, then deep in the refrigerator itself. Then, Gilbert struck gold. Hidden in a drawer below the bottom shelf, was a plastic container. He took it out and placed it on the table exclaiming, “Sally, I present to you the secret ingredient. Cottage cheese.”
	Through the minds of six-year-old children, they thought they would live happily ever after, but they soon realized they weren’t living in a fairytale. From the first bite of their first grilled cottage cheese sandwich, they knew they had made a terrible mistake. Nauseated after taking a second bite, Gilbert moaned, “This tastes like dog barf.”
	Forcing herself not to vomit, Sally groaned, “If it tasted like dog barf, it wouldn’t be so bad.” She forced herself to look at the unused cheese on the table. “I quit. I’m putting this all away and throwing out the rest.”
	Then, a familiar but unwelcome voice joined in. “No one is throwing away any food out of my kitchen.”
	Gilbert turned towards the kitchen door and found Sally’s mother glaring at their mess. “Mrs. Green,” he moaned.
	Icily, she replied. “I want you to pick up this mess and clean up the dishes. Put everything back in the refrigerator, and as for what you concocted in here, I want you two to eat it. Nothing is going to be thrown out. Do you understand?”
	Silently, Gilbert and Sally nodded their heads and began to put the unused cheese away. Then, Sally washed the dishes and Gee dried them. When they finished, there was one dish left on the table and it was stacked high with gooey cheese, mixed with cottage cheese. A pallid look crossed both of their faces as they faced their dreaded task. 
	Reluctantly, Sally picked up two spoons and gingerly handed one to Gee. Shaking her head, she mumbled, “The sooner we start, the sooner we finish.”
	Gilbert forced himself to take the first bite. As the slime slid across his tongue and slithered down his throat, Gilbert gagged. Quickly, he took a sip of water and wiped the sweat off his brow. After he recovered, he took a second bite. When that settled in his stomach, Gilbert forced himself to smile and said, “It’s not so bad, Sally, once you get used to it.”
	With those words of encouragement ringing in her ears, she joined in the feast. Slowly, but surely, the plate of cheese diminished until it was finally gone. With their self-inflicted torture behind them, Gilbert and Sally cleaned the last of the dishes. 
	It was over. Gilbert’s mother’s recipe was to remain a secret. Filled to the point of gilbert thinking cheese was going to ooze out his ears, Gilbert said his good-byes and started for home. Doubled over in pain, Gilbert treaded up his sidewalk and walked through the door. 
	As soon as the door closed behind him, Gilbert’s mother called out, “Gee, is that you? Come to the kitchen. I have a surprise for you.”
	Not wanting to share my morning experience with her, Gilbert held himself up straight and entered. “Hi, Mom. What’s up?”
 
	She hugged Gilbert and whispered in his ear, “It’s lunchtime and I made your favorite meal for you. 
sandwiches. See?”
	Fearfully, Gilbert peered at the table and found his archenemy waiting for him. Sheepishly, Gilbert looked at his mother and pleaded, “I’m not hungry.”
	But Gilbert’s mother insisted. “I won’t take no for an answer. You’re a growing boy and you need your energy. Now sit down and clean your plate.”
	By that evening, Gilbert was lying in bed with a stomachache. As he laid there in agony, he turned towards his honorary 
 and said, “How do I get myself in these situations?”
	As if in reply, Gilbert could almost hear 
 saying, “Growing up is a wonderful experience, but without occasional pain along the way, you can never truly know how much you’ve grown.”
	Comforted with this thought Gilbert rolled over and went to sleep. As he was about to visit dreamland, he thought, tomorrow’s Sunday. What could possibly happen?",Cheesy Kid's Stuff
,"Inspirational, Kids, Contemporary","The Decision
 
 
	Anna walked to the back of the cafe and sat down in the last booth. She wasn’t sure why she chose that booth. Maybe she thought she was going to need privacy or maybe she just wanted a clear view of the entrance doors so that she could prepare herself. She wasn’t sure but the last booth made her feel a little safer. Within a minute, Sally showed up at her table with a pot of hot coffee in her hand. Sally looked middle-aged and tired. Her bleach blonde hair was sitting on the top of her head in a messy bun. She had a full face of  makeup, including drawn in eyebrows and dark red lipstick that had already faded a bit from the freshness of the morning. 
	“Good morning. Coffee?” Sally asked, turning the heavy, white coffee cup over in anticipation of the hot beverage. 
           “Sure.” Anna replied. “Thank you. Someone will be joining me shortly.”
She set a menu in front of Anna as she carefully filled the cup. From her pocket, she pulled two little containers of creamer and two packets of sugar. 
	“Alrighty, I will be back to get your order after they arrive.”
	“Thanks,” Anna mumbled. 
	Anna watched the front door. Three men came in and sat down on the bar stools that lined the counter. An older couple followed them in and took the first booth near the door. Sally seemed to know both groups of people and shouted a greeting to all of them. 
Anna took her phone from her purse and checked the time. It was 9:45. They were scheduled to meet at 10:00.  She had shown up early because she was so nervous. She wondered if he would be on time or late or if he would show up at all. 
She had had second thoughts about coming.  She wanted so much to see him, but she was scared. The door creaked, she looked up quickly. It was a young woman dressed in a uniform that was identical to Sally’s. Patrons in the restaurant knew her and said hello as she made her way behind the counter and into the kitchen. 
	Anna took a deep breath and looked out the large window that her booth sat next to. Her thoughts wandered back thirty- two years ago to the moment in the bathroom at her mother’s house. She had peed on two sticks and within a minute both tests showed positive for pregnancy. She remembered how scared she felt as she went down stairs to tell her mom. 
	Her mother had been angry or disappointed. Anna couldn’t tell because she was crying and screaming at the same time.
	“You have messed up your life! What are we supposed to do now?” Anna had remembered thinking- it isn’t a matter of “we,” it was a matter of her. What was she going to do? At that moment, Anna realized that she had suddenly become an adult and had to make real decisions. Life changing decisions. 
	Once her mother had finished yelling at her, Anna drove to Scott’s apartment. She knew that the adult thing to do was to tell him that he was going to be a father. She knew that he wasn’t going to be excited about the news because he had just been accepted to John Hopkins School of Medicine and was excited about becoming a pediatrician. She and Scott had been together for two years. They loved each other in as complete a way that two college students could love. They had talked about possibly having a future together, but they knew there were things that they both wanted and needed to do before that future would come. Scott was moving to Baltimore and she was planning to study Journalism at Arizona State University. She had been accepted just a month prior. 
	 When Anna had arrived at Scott’s apartment building, her heart was pounding harder than it ever had.  She started taking deep breaths, trying to calm her racing pulse.. 
She sat in her car staring out the window. What was she going to say? What was he going to say? With two more deep breaths, she opened her car door and walked to his apartment door. 
She knocked. A moment later Scott pulled the door open. 
	“ Hey you, why you knocking? Why didn’t you just come in?” 
	Scott was so handsome. He was tall and olive skinned. His dark hair was full of gentle curls that framed his face. His black eyebrows and eyelashes made his ocean blue eyes pop out in a mesmerizing way. When he smiled, his left cheek filled with a deep dimple. He reached his arms out and pulled Anna into his chest. She held onto him, taking in his scent. 
	“Everything okay, Baby?” he asked as he walked her to the couch.
	Anna took a deep breath. She couldn’t look at him. He began to stroke her long brown hair. 
	“Scott, I’m pregnant.” 
	Silence. Scott took a deep breath and stood up. He walked around the small living room without saying a word. Anna looked up at him as tears slowly ran down her cheeks.
	“Are you sure?’ he finally asked.
	“Yes. I have been sick every morning for the last two weeks, I’m late and I took a test. Two tests.  They were both positive.” 
	Scott sat back down next to her, taking her hands in his. 
	“Anna, it’s going to be okay. I love you and you love me, and we made a baby.”
	 For the next hour, Scott and Anna had laid on the couch in silence both filled with their own thoughts about their futures. 
	After a few weeks of talking, Sott and Anna had made the difficult decision that the best thing that they could do for their baby was to put him up for adoption. They were introduced to a loving couple that had been trying for several years to have a baby of their own. They had had numerous miscarriages and unseccessful attempts. Scott and Anna decided they would be the people to have their baby. 
	The baby boy had been born on a rainy July morning. When they laid him on Anna’s chest, she felt a love that she had never felt before. She kissed his forehead and whispered, “I love you, son.” Scott leaned over Anna and the baby. He kissed them both. As the nurse took the baby to be cleaned up, Scott took Anna’s hand and told her that he loved her. That was the last time they saw their baby in person. 
	“Would you like a refill?” Sally interrupted Anna’s thoughts. She looked up to see the waitress standing there with the pop of coffee.
	“Oh, no, thank you.” Anna murmured as the cafe door opened. She knew immediately that the young man that had walked in was her son. He looked like Scott. Handsome, dark curly hair, olive skin. He scanned the cafe and then made his way down to her booth. 
	“Anna?” 
	“Yeah, uh, yeah, hi. I’m Anna. Ryan?”
	Sally piped in asking him if he would like some coffee. 
	“No, thank you, ma’am. I would like some iced tea, please.” Ryan said as he sat down.
“Sorry I am a bit late. Traffic was a little thicker than I thought it would be.” he smiled and Anna saw the same dimple that his father had. 
	Anna’s heart was beating so hard. She couldn’t believe that her baby boy was sitting in front of her. She didn’t know what to say. She bit her lower lip.
	“I know. It’s a little awkward meeting. I hope it’s okay.” Ryan said nervously.
	‘Oh, yes, it’s wonderful. I just never really thought I would see you again. The last time I saw you, you were only moments old.” Anna said as tears welled up in her eyes.
	“ My parents, Shane and Heather, told me that I was adopted when I was five years old. I don’t think I really understood what that was, but they would always tell me that I had another mother and father that loved me enough to let them raise me. I have to be honest, as I went through my teens and  twenties, I was hurt. I wondered how a mom and dad could give up their own child. My parents just kept reassuring me that it was a decision made out of love. They would tell me that one day I would understand.”
	Anna started to cry.
	“Oh, Ryan!  Your father and I did love you so much, and we loved each other. We were just so young. We weren’t married, we didn’t have money, we were getting ready to go to college, we just weren’t ready to be the parents that you deserved. It broke our hearts to let you go. We wanted you to have a good life.”  She saw tears well up in Ryan’s baby blue eyes. 
	“That’s what my parents told me.” Ryan whispered, trying to pull himself back together.
	Anna took a tissue from her purse and wiped her eyes as Sally arrived at the table with Ryan’s iced tea. “Are you two ready to order?” 
	Anna and Ryan both chose to have a piece of key lime pie. 
	“Got it!” Sally said as she made her way to the kitchen. 
	Ryan had pulled himself together and said. “So tell me about yourself.”
	Anna shared that she had gone to college and earned her degree in journalism. Upon graduating, she had gotten a job at a small newspaper in Phoenix. Then she became interested in editing. She got a job as a copy editor at a small publishing house. She did that for several years and then became an editor.  Two years ago, she opened her own editing company.” 
	Sally sat the two pieces of pie down in front of them.
	“Thank you.” They both said.
	There were a few moments of silence as they took a bite of the pie. Ryan set his fork down.
	“Um, I know Scott died.” he blurted out uneasily. 
	Anna took a deep breath, and looked down at the table. She put her fork down. Tears filled her eyes. 
	“Yes, he did. A car accident five years ago.” Her eyes turned toward the window. In that moment, all the pain of the loss rushed through her. She bit her lower lip trying to hold back the tears. 
	“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything.” Ryan quietly said.
	“No, it’s okay. You have a right to know.” Anna took a deep breath and slowly began speaking.
	“After you were adopted, your father did go to John Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. He had just finished his third year.  Um, he was driving home for his summer break, and, um, there was an accident.” Anna looked away as the tears came down her cheeks again.
“He was going too fast, missed a curve and rolled his car. He was ejected and died right there.” 
	“Wow, that’s tough.” Ryan whispered.
 	Anna took several more deep breaths and wiped the tears away. 
“Yea, it was really painful and still is.” Anna paused and then said, “ He kissed you when you were born. He loved you, and I know that he would have been proud of you.”
	This time Ryan looked out the window as he took Anna’s words in.
	“Well, tell me about you. How has your life been?’
	“My life..” Ryan said and paused. “Well, like I said, I knew that I was adopted from the time I was five. I mean, we didn’t talk about it all the time, but I knew and whenever I asked questions, both my parents were happy to share.  My parents were so great and they gave me a good life filled with love. When I got into junior high school, I remember them asking me if I wanted to find you and my father. I was a teenager and was full of hormones and attitude. I put the idea in my head that a good person doesn’t give up their kid and I told them no.” 
	Anna looked down. “I’m sorry.” Pain filled her heart.
	“I kept that attitude for a long time. I think it was just easier than thinking about dealing with it.  Anyway, went through high school and college. Graduated and got a job as a middle school P.E. teacher. Met a great gal and got married ten years ago. We were together for five years before we decided to have a kid.”
	Anna smiled, “You have a child?”
	“Two. Katie is five and Sam is 3.” Ryan said proudly. His gentle smile gave way to the dimple that reminded her of Scott. 
	“Wow.” Anna said smiling. 
	“One night the kids climbed into bed with my wife and I because there was a thunderstorm outside and they were afraid. They fell asleep between us. We laid there looking at each other and them. “Can you imagine having to give up these babies to someone else to raise? My wife had asked. It must have been so hard for your parents to make that decision. I am so thankful that you ended up having good loving parents, but I wonder if your parents ever had healing in their hearts.” 
	Anna cried. 
	Ryan continued. “It was at that moment, I understood what my parents had been trying to  tell me. That you and Scott loved me enough to let me go. As a father, I understand how hard that would be.”
	Anna put the tissue to her eyes, but could not stop the tears that poured from them.
	Ryan took her hand. 
	“Mom, I understand. And I love you for what you did. Thank you.”
	Ryan and I spent the next hour chatting and catching up. He shared pictures of his wife and children and we exchanged addresses and made plans to get together.
	He walked me to my car, gave me a long hug and said. 
	“I will see you soon, Mom.”
	I got in my car and sat there smiling and crying.
	“After thirty-two years of waiting, I am finally a mom! And a grandma!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ",The Decision
,"Fiction, Funny, Kids"," 
“It is the best!” screamed Martha.
“Jacob hates it!” retorted Susan.
“Susan, you cook the most delicious ‘Grilled Cheese’ with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables,” Martha repeated.
“It tastes great.”
“Make sure you include your recipe for ‘Grilled Cheese’ in next month’s kindergarten edition magazine!” added Martha.
Susan was a big fan of cooking. While she was a child, she used to play with whisks and spatulas. She used to watch cooking shows and pretend she was hosting one.
“A hint of butter and some love…” she would speak as part of her script as a MasterChef, stirring an empty pan.
She used to watch her mom in the kitchen; whisking batters, blending ingredients, tossing vegetables, mixing marinades, and so on. When she was three years old, she used to whisk eggs and whip cream to soft peaks for desserts. Also, she was great at putting together a great salad but what she churned out herself was the perfect Grilled Cheese, soft from the inside and crispy from the outside! However, Martha was different. She was oblivious to cooking and enjoyed it that way. 
Martha and Susan were arguing about Susan’s specialty all morning. Susan was eight and Martha nine.
“Jacob and James are coming home tomorrow, let’s make grilled cheese and pasta and we’ll call for doughnuts. The boys would love it,” said Martha, convincingly. That night Martha, Mom, Susan and Dad sat for dinner.
“So, girls I hear you have friends coming over tomorrow. What is the occasion?” asked Dad, inquisitively.
“The girls are celebrating Valentine’s Day,” chimed in Mom.
“Yeah, but it’s June!” Dad sounded perplexed.
“Dad, Jacob and James weren’t in town that time, so we decided to celebrate Valentine’s Day during the summer break.”
Without saying a word, Dad took the next bite of the rice in his plate. Dinner time with the family was always interesting but this was phenomenal. That night, the girls sat with their parents deciding on their clothes and menu. The four of them sat together in the living room jotting down lists.
“Did you decide the games you are going to play?” Dad asked!
“Who plays games at our age?” asked Susan, based on eight years of juvenile experience.
“Infact, we want to make sure tomorrow that they aren’t playing games with us,” said Martha, flipping through the recipe book.
Both the parents were baffled, yet they laughed through this! Finally, they returned to their bedrooms awaiting a monumental celebration ahead.
Twirling her golden curls around her finger, Martha asked Susan, “Do you think I should wear my red strappy dress or little black dress?”
“Well, I was thinking I would wear my silver sequin top with my black skirt that we got from Milan last year,” she paused for a moment, “and Mom can do up my hair in a braid.”
“Awesome!” she said “but I shall let them loose,” said Martha.
“Wear your strappy dress, but the lavender one,” suggested Susan.
The girls were relieved because their attire was in place. Meanwhile, Mom and Dad were restless in their bedroom like fish out of water.
“Josie, what are these two upto?”
“Will, take it easy. They are too young!”
“Maybe I am too old.”
He turned around and drifted off to sleep. Josie put her arm around his waist as she fell into a deep sleep.
The next morning, everything carried on as usual. Josie was in the kitchen, preparing everyone's breakfast. The eggs were jumping in the pan of boiling hot water, and the slices of bread were hopping in and out of the toaster. The fragrance of the brewing coffee filled the air. The colorful berries and watermelon filled up the glistening bowls. Josie arranged white China on the kitchen table along with mugs and large tumblers for the girls.
“Martha! Susan! Come down girls, breakfast is ready.” Josie hollered from the kitchen.
The girls were fast asleep in bed, tucked in, tired, yet relieved from the previous night’s discussion.
Will tiptoed into their room, watching his little blossoms, asleep. He sat motionless, transfixed by how were growing.
“Wake up! Love you, Martha.”
“Wake up! Love you, Susan.”
They stirred a little in bed while Will kept waking them up, gently.
Suddenly, something happened and the two of them sprung up. Both hugged their dad, brushed their teeth, tied up their locks and rushed downstairs. Dad ran behind them and the three of them sat at the table. Josie poured some coffee into two mugs, buttered four slices of bread, peeled the eggs and served everyone. The fruit was served separately in bowls.
“Here’s your chocolate shake with less sugar, Martha,” said Mum.
Susan looked at her mother, questioningly.
“Here’s your chocolate shake with extra chocolate, Susan.”
The four of them ate happily.
“Why did the two of you rush down, leaving me behind?” asked Dad.
“James and Jacob are coming; we need to prepare,” Martha spoke aloud.
“Susan needs to cook her specialty, grilled cheese!” Martha insisted while Susan looked reluctant.
“Alright! But Jacob doesn’t eat it, don’t want to upset him.”
“But James loves it, so don’t want to upset him either!” added Martha.
Josie and Will couldn’t believe what was happening. Two little girls, two little boys, Valentine’s Day in June… Was everything alright? The girls gobbled the toast and egg and gulped down their shakes. They never took less than an hour to finish breakfast, but today was a miracle. Now they were at work…
Martha and Mom cleaned the larger table where the guests ate. The covers of the table were changed and the gold placemats were neatly arranged along with delicate tableware. The golden cutlery glowed brighter than the sun. Right at the center of the table, an enormous flower vase was arranged with the finest blooms plucked from the neighbor’s backyard. The white napkins with a dainty floral print were folded perfectly and kept straight on the plates. The wine goblets sparkled, ready to be filled with Berry Blast Soda, another specialty to be made at home.
The plastic pools were inflated and filled with water in the backyard. Fresh towels, sunscreen lotions, and cartons of juice were arranged.
""What's happening in the backyard?"" Will was curious.
 ""In case the boys felt like swimming..."" said Susan. Both Will and Josie were startled.
“What is all this happening?” whispered Will in Josie’s ear.
“Are they okay?"" he asked again.
“They are in love!” laughed Josie.
Will was losing his balance at the mention of ‘L-O-V-E.’
Meanwhile, Susan was frantic in the kitchen.
“Mom, where are the tomatoes?”
“The mustard?”
“The boiled potatoes?”
“The cauliflower?”
“The carrots?”
“The beans?”
“The broccoli?”
“Boiled pasta?”
“I can’t find anything…” she yelled.
Mother marched into the kitchen and turned her daughter around.
“Everything is done. I cooked early this morning.” She smiled and asked her to go get ready.
""By the way, I also ordered ice cream. The doughnuts would be arriving shortly.”
Susan embraced her mother.
“You are the most caring mother!” she said. Only an hour was left for the boys to come in.
Susan left the kitchen and was heading to the bathroom. Just then she remembered something. She dashed like a bullet.
“Martha…Mom…Dad… where is the cheese?” Worried, she said, “I haven’t made that yet.”
Suddenly, the excitement diminished and Martha almost fainted thinking about what James would eat. It seemed like a tsunami hit their lives.
“I will just get the cheese out of the fridge. Don’t worry,” Mom said. Martha and Susan waited in the kitchen. Dad was finally ready for work.
“See you girls, Happy Valentine's Day,"" he said as he left, closing the door behind him.
The girls waited for mom to arrive with a block of cheese.
“Mom where is the cheese?” she asked fearfully. Susan’s entire body was cringing nervously.
Josie had literally dived into the fridge, with most of her inside it.
“There is no cheese,” she screamed from inside.
“There is no… cheese?” Martha screamed!
“Oh! My poor Jacob will starve.”
Susan hit Martha with the spatula lying on the slab, instructing her to keep quiet. Just forty minutes remained for the boys to arrive.
“I am sorry girls; I don’t know how I forgot to order the cheese.”
“Mom, call up the store and ask him to deliver it now before Martha gets admitted to the hospital. We need to save Martha. It is critical.”
Understanding the gravity of the situation, Josie called the shop. It kept ringing, but finally, Mr. Wilson answered.
“Wilson’s Will Deliver, how may I help you?” said Mr. Wilson in a raspy voice.
“Josie here, I need a large block of cheese in the next five minutes,” Mother pleaded with desperation.
“Sure, we have a discount on …” Mother didn’t allow him to complete the sentence.
“It’s urgent, just cheese please.”
“…but I was saying, we have five Berry Blast cans free with the cheese”
“Send it please!”
“Sure, Josie.”
Josie disconnected the call, stifling the chance for any further conversation with Mr. Wilson who loved chatting away. The three of them prepared the marinade.
“Girls, why don’t you get ready? I will make the cheese as Susan does,” she promised, firmly.
“What if James doesn’t like it?”
Susan dragged her out of the kitchen and shoved her into the bathroom. Twenty minutes were left and there was no sign of the cheese. In the meantime, Susan prayed for a miracle.
Martha, came out of the dressing room all dressed. Her hair was loose and her lavender dress made her look like a fresh bloom from the early spring. She slipped into her silver ballerina shoes and looked stunning.
“James will not eat the cheese; he would be so busy looking at you. You look wonderful!” Susan hugged her.
“Has Mr. Wilson sent the cheese?” Martha blurted.
Susan went in angrily. She slammed the bathroom door.
“You are mad!” she shouted from there.
Just then the doorbell rang. Martha peeped from the window. She was relieved to see Old Mr. Wilson walk in slowly, swinging the packet of cheese.
“Susan, the cheese is here!” Martha squealed with delight.
“Come out MasterChef and create magic!”
Susan had stopped responding to her. She thought Martha was possessed.
While Susan got ready at her own pace, Martha’s impatience heightened. Susan walked out, and Martha was unable to stop staring at her. Her lithe figure was beautifully accentuated by silver sequins and a black skirt that glinted like stars. A pair of strappy black sandals completed her look.
""Let's do the cheese,"" she said angrily to Martha.
When they reached the kitchen, mom was working like a robot. All Susan had to do was slice the cheese, dip it in the marinade and place it on the wire rack. She thought mom had made a great marinade. The consistency was just right and so was the taste. Only five or ten minutes remained for the guests to arrive. Susan wore her apron, carefully dipped the slices of cheese into the marinade, and placed them on the wire rack. The eight large slices were finally in the oven and Martha began to look normal. Her diminished trauma restored the color of her face. Ultimately, the doorbell rang. The girls shrieked in excitement. They hurried to open the door.
“Devour Doughnuts! This is your delivery boy, Dennis.”
“Thanks, Dennis! But we thought it was someone else.”
She handed over the money and closed the door. She arranged the doughnuts on a flat basket lined with beautiful paper.
Susan and Martha sat on the lawn. Under the shade of swaying trees, they waited for Jacob and James to arrive. There were bright yellow and crimson blooms adorning the garden, making it look flawless. There was a screech of a black limousine outside their residence at that moment. Astonished, they stared. A chauffeur emerged from the car and opened the door. In walked two black-clad boys, their hair spiked and smothered with gel. They gaped at the sight of figures just three feet tall. The two were James and Jacob. “Happy Valentine’s Day, Martha,” said James, giving her a tiny box with a matching teal ribbon that sealed it. It looked gorgeous.
“Thank you,” she whispered.
Jacob hugged Susan and handed her a long rectangular box.
“What is this?” she asked.
He smiled and said, “a little something for you.”
The boys greeted Josie and handed her a bouquet of flowers along with a bottle of Cola.
The four of them sat at the table. Mother served the four of them fresh plum juice and crackers. The strong fragrance of their Citrus colognes overpowered the softness of the British Rose, that the girls wore.
“Susan, you look gorgeous, “said Jacob.
Unable to hide her smile, she whispered, “Thank you.”
An hour had passed, and it was almost time for lunch. Both the girls along with their mother made the boys comfortable at the dining table and headed into the kitchen. Martha and Susan started heating the pasta, laying out the veggies on an enormous platter, filling the water jug, and arranging the pitcher of the berry cooler on the large tray. They opened the oven to pull out the wire rack with the grilled cheese. A cloud of smoke billowed from the oven, paralyzing the three of them in horror.
“What have you done Susan?” screamed Martha, in horror.
“What have I done?” yelled Susan
“Let’s fix it,” said Mother.
Nothing could be done to fix the burnt cheese slices. There was a crestfallen expression on the faces of all three of them. The girls were weeping and the boys sat hungrily at the table. Quickly, mother arranged all that was ready on a vast tray and carried it to the table. The girls followed behind meekly. James and Jacob looked at the tray, but not with much interest. 
 “So, James,” said Mother, “How are Mom and Dad?” She served the pasta carefully and added some steamed vegetables on the side. The plate looked beautiful and vibrant.
“Thanks, Ms. Josie, Mum and Dad are fine.” He answered, taking the first bite of pasta. The girls nervously observed whatever was going on.
“Jacob, how about school?”
“School is great, James was unwell so he didn’t attend the whole of last week.”
“I am sorry to hear that,” said Josie
“Mom, he developed some allergies,"" added Martha.
By then, Jacob had also started eating his meal. Martha and Susan served the Berry Blast and then ate with the boys. Mother sat with them, hoping the girls weren’t dismayed. Soon, everything seemed fine!
“Can I have some more pasta?"" asked James.
Immediately, Martha jumped from her seat and assisted her mother in serving James. She was relieved that James ate well. The four of them laughed and devoured the meal.
“Thanks for the wonderful meal, Aunt Josie,” said James.
“Indeed, the pasta was just fabulous,” added Jacob.
Both girls looked at their mother, feeling proud of her effort. The table was cleared and laid again for dessert. The dessert bowls were topped with ice cream and the doughnuts were served. The girls had forgotten about the burnt cheese. They sat in silence for a moment.
“I am glad the meal was light with no cheese,” said James, ""and I would avoid ice cream.”
Josie, Martha, and Susan looked at each other, bewildered.
“My test reports came in last night. I was tested for various allergies. It turns out to be that cheese, milk, and eggs don’t suit me as much.”
When the three of them heard what James said, they smiled.
“Thank God!” said Martha, delightfully.
… the party continued till Will laughed his gut out hearing the entire day’s happenings.",Cheesy without Cheese
,"Kids, Fiction, Bedtime","	Gilbert Einstein awoke to the smell of breakfast simmering in the kitchen. His stomach growled with hunger, but he didn’t go downstairs immediately. I’m forgetting something, he thought. But as much as he tried, Gilbert couldn’t recall what it was, so he jumped out of bed, got dressed and made a mad dash downstairs. “Good morning, Mom,” he cried out. “What’s cooking?”
	“Eggs and bacon, Gilbert, or should I call you Gee?”
	Since the first day of school, Gilbert had been called Gee Einstein by everyone in his class, including his teacher, and now it seems his mother had heard the news. “Whatever you want, Mom. I’m happy either way.”
	She placed a plate of bacon and eggs on the table, next to a glass of orange juice. “Eat up, Gilbert. You’ve got a busy day ahead of you.”
	Secretly, Gilbert was relieved to hear his mother’s choice. Though he didn’t mind hearing himself being called Gee or Gee Einstein by anyone at school, it felt good knowing he would come home and be called by his real name. After wolfing down his breakfast and clearing the table, Gilbert ran out the door calling back to his mother, “Got to catch the bus, Mom. See you later.” And like that, he was gone.
	By the time Gilbert reached the bus stop, he found the bus was already waiting for him. So, without hesitating, he hopped in the open door and sat in the first seat he could find. When he looked to see who he was sitting with, he found Sally Green in the seat next to him.
	Gee Einstein, couldn’t you cut the time any closer?” Sally sarcastically replied. “I hope you’re better on the spelling test tomorrow than you are at getting on the bus.”
	It was as if the lights were turned on in Gilbert’s head. That’s what I forgot. Gilbert’s heart sank and he wailed, “The spelling test is tomorrow? You’ve got to be kidding me.”
	“Weren’t you listening to the teacher, Gee? Just before we got out of class, yesterday, she told us she would hand out a list of twenty spelling words today and we would be taking the test tomorrow.”
	Sally’s dire warning rang like a fire drill bell in Gilbert’s head, for he knew spelling was his one weakness. 
	What am I going to do, he thought? There’s no way I can learn to spell so many words in one day. He thought about studying as soon as he got home, but there was one problem. There’s going to be an after school special on TV that I really wanted to watch. Should I skip it and study for the test? He knew there was no way he was going to do that. I can study after supper.
	So, Gilbert went to school and sure enough, at the end of the day, the teacher handed a list of twenty words to each of the students. As soon as Gilbert got his, he stuffed it in his backpack and went directly home. 
	For a moment, he thought skipping TV and study his spelling, but that thought quickly dispersed, and he turned on the TV to begin watching the after school special. There, he sat until his mother called him to dinner.
	As they sat around the table, Gilbert’s mother spoke. “I have a surprise for you, Gilbert. I went to the store and bought that video you wanted so much.”
	Filled with excitement, Gilbert blurted out, “Really? You bought the Buzz Lightyear DVD for me? Thanks, Mom! Can I watch it tonight?”
	Gilbert’s mother smiled. “Well, if you don’t have anything else to do, I don’t see why not.”
	The thought of the upcoming spelling test lingered in Gilbert’s mind. I really need to study for that test, he thought. If I don’t do well on it, the other kids won’t let me forget. 
	Since the first day of school, Gilbert’s classmates picked on him for having the last name of Einstein. But for the last couple weeks, they seemed to have forgotten him and moved on to other distractions. He was afraid if he failed the test, they would pounce on him again.
	But I really want to see the movie, he thought. The image of the sheet of paper with twenty spelling words entered his mind. What should I do? The movie or study? Taking a deep breath, he made his decision. “I’m finished eating, Mom. Can I watch the movie now?” And with that, Gilbert found himself in front of the TV until it was bedtime.
	Later that night, as Gilbert lied in bed, he began to dwell on the decisions he made today. Maybe I should have watched the movie later. I could have seen that anytime, he thought. But the spelling test is still tomorrow. He glanced at his unopened backpack, then at the poster of Albert Einstein on his wall. What do you think, Uncle Albert? Do I have time to study now?
	It was no surprise to Gilbert when Uncle Albert didn’t answer, so he decided for himself. Grabbing his backpack, he unzipped it and pulled out the spelling words. I’ve got all night to learn these words. With a little luck I should be able to ace that test tomorrow. Delighted with his plan, Gilbert began reciting the words on the list. “Dog, D-O-G. Cat, C-A-T. Cow, C-O-W… 
	Time dragged on and Gilbert nodded off several times. Still, he forced himself to stay awake and continued to study. Easy, E-A-S-Y. House, H-O-U-S-E…
	Gilbert was abruptly awakened by his mother’s voice. “Hurry up, Gilbert. The bus will be here shortly.”
	Looking at the clock, Gilbert realized of how little time he had. Driving himself into high gear, he jumped into his clothes, ran to the kitchen, and out the door. As he neared the street corner, his jaw dropped as he spotted the school bus driving away. Too late, he thought. Now I have to ask Mom to take me to school. 
	As Gilbert’s mother drove him to school, Gilbert could barely keep his eyes open. I’m so sleepy, he thought. How can I take the test? I can’t even remember what the words are, not to mention even how to spell them. Maybe if Mom drives slow enough, it’ll be too late for me to take the test, then I won’t have to worry about it. 
	Unfortunately for Gilbert, it wasn’t his lucky day. His mother arrived on time and Gilbert was sitting in the class, just as attendance was being taken. “Okay,” his teacher cried out. “Clear off your desks. We’re going to take the spelling test now.” She handed out blank papers to everyone and began to recite the spelling words. As she did so, everyone wrote down the answers, except for Gilbert. After he heard each word, he stumbled and faltered, and found himself struggling with even the simplest of words. After the teacher recited the last spelling word, the ordeal was over. 
	Everyone traded their test papers and began to score them. As Gilbert heard the correct spelling for the first word, he groaned to himself. How could I misspell Cat, he thought? And the list went on. When the corrected tests were returned, Gilbert was pleasantly surprised to see he did as well as he did. Fifty-five was better than zero. 
	But the rest of the children thought differently. “Gee Einstein, shouldn’t you have done better than that?” or “Gee whiz, Gee, what’s wrong with you?”
	But Gilbert was too tired to be phased by their remarks. All he wanted to do was go home and sleep and when school finally let out, that’s exactly what he did. As soon as he got home, Gilbert jumped into bed and fell asleep.
	It wasn’t until suppertime when his mother stirred him from his sleep. “Are you feeling well, son? It’s not like you to sleep so much.”
	“I’m fine, Mother,” he said. Then he told her what happened the night before. The scolding he received was no surprise to him, but beyond that, there was no further punishment. 
	“I think staying awake for so long is enough punishment for one day,” his mother chided him. After supper, you’ll go to your room and get some sleep.”
	There was no argument from him. After supper, and without changing onto his pajamas, he jumped into bed and looked at his poster. “Good night, Uncle Albert. I don’t know how you did it, but I know it wasn’t when you were supposed to be sleeping.” 
	Gilbert closed his eyes and instantly fell asleep. That night, he dreamed about Einstein and how he changed the world with his eyes wide opened. ","Gee Einstein, Stay Awake"
,"Kids, Fiction, Drama","Henry Tiller's evil heckle rose above the others. I had one simple line in the Christmas play and somehow, for the third time this week, I managed to mess that up. 
 
""It's a Christmas m... marble."" I stuttered.
 
""Miracle. Catherine. The word is miracle."" Ms. Haywood's gentle voice whispered.
 
Though the eyes in the crowd seemed to burn holes through my skin, my body shivered in the freezing air of the auditorium. I closed my eyes and tried to hide from the gawking faces staring back at me. I whispered, “Miracle.”
 
Thankfully, it’s the last line in this year’s Christmas skit and practice is finally over. Ms. Haywood dismissed class for the day. Exiting the stage, I took two steps and my left foot tangled in the hem of the robe I wore as a costume. I landed flat on my face. When I opened my eyes, I stared at the speckled tile two inches from my nose. The only thing I wanted at this moment was a hole to open beneath my body and swallow me into the depths of the earth under that stage.
 
Nancy's voice was kind. ""Here Cat, let me help you."" Her small hand reached out for mine.
 
I grabbed Nancy's hand. ""One day I'm going to punch that stupid Henry right in his freckled nose."" I said as I got on my feet.
 
I walked into the purple wonderland belonging to Ms. Haywood. I grabbed my bookbag from the hook hanging on the lavender wall. A white label had been stuck just above the violet hook with my name typed in bright purple block letters. No one had to guess Ms. Haywood’s favorite color. Everything in her classroom was some shade of violet, lavender or even plum. Who would have known there were so many shades of purple in the world?
 
""Catherine, let’s have a little chat.” Ms. Haywood's voice startled me when she stepped into the room.
 
I slung the backpack over my shoulder and walked towards the grape-colored desk in front of the room.
 
""Jennifer isn't feeling well. The nurse says her temperature is over one hundred and she probably has that nasty stomach bug going around.” 
 
Ms. Haywood lifted a stack of papers from her desk. “Carry this home and memorize her lines tonight.” 
 
""B...but the play is tomorrow. I won’t have time."" I stammered.
 
""I know it’s tomorrow, but someone needs to say her lines. She only had four and since you only had one, you are the perfect person to say her lines in her absence.""
 
I choke out the words, ""I don't think I can.""
 
""Of course you can. I have no doubt.""
 
Tears formed in the corners of my eyes and rolled down my cheeks. I stared at the floor. Ms. Haywood reached into the cardboard box covered in lilac lilies and pulled out a tissue. I accepted it with trembling hands.
 
""I think I know what you need."" Ms. Haywood opened the top drawer of her desk and rambled through pens, pencils, and other little things. When she pulled out her hand, she kept her fist closed around the object she’d retrieved.
 
""Here this is for you.” She extended her arm in my direction. “Keep it in your pocket for good luck.""
 
I opened my hand, and she dropped a sparkling magenta rock the size of a ping pong ball into my palm. I wrinkled my brow. ""What is it?""
 
""It's my good luck rock. When I was young, I played piano. I loved it, but I hated to perform.""
 
I took the rock from her hand. I gazed at its sparkling beauty while Ms. Haywood told a story.
 
""Dad died in the war leaving Mom to care for the two of us by herself. She took the only job she could find at a bar in the city. In the corner of the bar stood an old piano no one ever played. Mom peeled the label from an old, rusted tin can and made a little tip jar for me to place on top of that piano. Mom wanted me to play while she worked. I wasn’t sure I could do it even though I knew we needed the money. 
On the first night, I sat on the worn bench and held my fingers over the keys with trembling hands. A bearded gentleman with white hair on his head hobbled over leaning on a cane. He reached in the pocket of his worn trousers and revealed the rock in your hand. He whispered in my ear as he told me about this good luck rock his grandfather had given him many years ago. He said if I kept it with me, I’d always do great when I played. That same evening, I made enough money to feed me and Mom for a week. I've kept this rock since that day.""
 
""I can't take your rock Ms. Haywood."" I held out my hand and offered it back.
 
""Of course, you can take it. Now put the rock in your pocket and go home. Memorize your lines tonight. Don't forget to put the good luck rock in your pocket tomorrow.""
 
I walked home from school dreaming about the excuses I could use to miss tomorrow night's performance of the Christmas play. I wondered if mom would believe I had a stomachache. Probably not, I thought, she's going to be angry anyway when she sees the bad grade on my math test tonight. I wouldn't show her, but Ms. Haywood agreed to add ten bonus points if I brought it back signed and I desperately need those ten points.
 
My sister Marlene stood in the kitchen when I walked into the house. ""Cat, look at the dress I'm wearing to the school Christmas program tomorrow.""
 
She swirled around like a graceful ballerina wearing a red velvet dress with lace at the hem just below her knees. It fit her slim frame perfectly and made me feel frumpy in my gray t-shirt and faded blue jeans with holes in the knees.
 
""It’s nice,"" I muttered walking past her.
 
""You didn't even look,"" she whined as I dashed down the hallway to my room.
 
I stood in the doorway to my messy bedroom. ""Sorry sis. I don't feel good.""
 
I shut the door and pounced on my bed. I reached in my pocket, grabbed the rock, and laid it beside me. 
 
My bedroom door flew open. ""What's that?"" Marlene asked.
 
""None of your business. Go away.""
 
""You're so mean."" Marlene slammed the door.
 
I locked the door and laid on the bed with the rock right beside me. I pulled the stack of papers from my bookbag. My new lines were all underlined in purple ink. I repeated them what felt like a million times engraving them into my brain. My eyes grew heavy. I slipped the rock inside my pillowcase and fell into a deep sleep.
 
The next morning on my way to school, I walked several yards down the sidewalk before I remembered the rock. I hurried back inside, grabbed it from inside the pillowcase and now running late, I sprinted towards school gripping the rock in my hand. Halfway to school Henry jumped out of the bushes directly in my path. Stopping abruptly to avoid the collision, I dropped the rock on the concrete near my foot. It bounced on impact just once and landed over in the grass. Henry darted towards it and picked it up before I even gathered my senses.
 
""What's this?"" His freckled face smirked as he held up the sparkling purple rock out of my reach. “Oh I know, it’s a m…. marble.” 
 
""Give that back."" I jumped trying to snatch the rock from his hand while he cackled.
 
When Henry cackled, rage overcame me. Without thinking I swiftly kicked him in the shin, and he buckled over and groaned in pain. I snatched the rock and ran as fast as I could.
 
Standing on the school steps and out of breath, I stuffed the rock inside my pocket before I went inside. I wondered if Henry would tell on me when he got here. But if he did, maybe they would send me home and not let me be in the play. I could only hope. Henry didn't tell on me though. I guess he was embarrassed that a girl nearly half his size sent him toppling over on the sidewalk in pain.
 
I made it through the school day and before I knew it, the time for the program had come. 
 
My heart raced as I stood on the stage staring into the blurry crowd. It was time to speak Jennifer’s first line but when I opened my mouth, I froze. I closed my eyes and reached for my pocket. With my fingers pressed against the good luck rock, I recited the first line without a hitch, each word flowing perfectly from my mouth.
 
I was elated it had worked. I relaxed and peered into the auditorium. My parents and Marlene sat six rows from the front and directly behind mean Henry. Next to Henry, a woman sat whom I guessed was his grandmother. She appeared to me the type who might knock him over the head if he even considered acting up.
 
It was time for my second line and out of the corner of my eye I saw Henry smirk. I looked away and pressed the rock in my pocket reciting the line with ease. I scanned the audience and noticed mom smiling like she did when I’d made her proud. I smiled too. This wasn’t so bad, I thought.
 
When the time came for the third line, I avoided Henry’s face and instead gazed into the crowd and spoke each word with perfection. Ms. Haywood caught my eye and winked.
 
The fourth line was the longest of all, but my hands didn’t tremble when I reached down to press against the rock in my pocket. I focused my eyes on Ms. Haywood’s face and repeated the lines without missing a beat. 
 
When it was time for the final line of the play, my confidence was high. I stared directly into Henry’s eyes when I said, ""It’s a Christmas miracle."" I articulated the words just perfectly and took a bow.
 
When the crowd’s applause filled the room, I lifted my head and opened my eyes. I guess Marlene caught that nasty stomach bug that's been going around the school because when I stole a glance at Henry, Marlene had vomited all over his head.

“Grrrr now Bea, we both know you’re going through lots of changes lately and it’s clearly affecting your behaviour and moods in lots of ways but you’re being really unfair now.”
“AM I? I THINK I’M BEING LITTLE MISS FAIREST OF THEM ALL!”
“Please Bea, just take a breath and try and think before you keep speaking.”
“… Pfffft okay I’ll talk normally for a bit. I’m fine, Daddy. I just think… maybe I deserve this!”
“Hey don’t be daft! Come on, come here, have one of my cosy bear hugs that always used to cheer you up.”

“Good grief! We really need to look at who you’re mixing with at school. Where are you picking up these things you’re coming out with?”
“Seriously! I’m too old for hugs, Daddy! Just try and listen to what I’m saying to you for once in your life!”
“Okay let me take a seat.”
“Oh!? What are you doing?”
“You think I never listen so here I am! I’m all ears.”
“Right! Didn’t expect you to… nevermind! Okay here goes… I’m just going to talk but if you interrupt me Daddy I will sleep in the flipping woods forever!”
“I promise… this is not me interrupting you by the way. Daddy mouth closed from now on.”
“Wow! The power! So here’s the thing… and I know you think I’m being silly but I’m so scared all the time. At home, at school, on holiday… everywhere! Life terrifies me. I want to be a baby forever! It’s so much easier not having any cares in the world, no troubles or strife, but I can feel and see I’m changing and I can’t control it. I know I’m being horrible to you and Mummy but I can’t seem to stop myself and… this doesn’t mean I will magically stop from now on! But I know you and Mummy will always forgive me… unless I scratch out your eyes or something. Don’t worry I won’t do that or run away or call Childline! I just say these things in the hope you’ll listen. If I had my way I’d stay at home forever but the thought of someone coming into our home, lounging on our furniture, eating our food and having a nap has really upset me. WHY CAN’T I BE NORMAL?? Maybe I will come in for a hug now.”
“Of course, come here little one. Oh Bea, you are completely normal to react like this! I know you feel we never listen but we do and we love you so much. You’re our baby, always will be, and the most important thing in our lives. Why else do you think your Mum has been upstairs cleaning up your room for the last hour? We want you to be happy so remember even though your feelings and emotions are out of our control, we do take your comments to heart because it upsets us to see you like this!”
“I know! It’s my stupid brain!”
“Oh stop that! It happens to us all.”
“Even you and Mummy?”
“Oh yeah! I remember shouting at my Dad so loud when I was a teenager that the kitchen windows shattered and our neighbour’s cat almost got its head chopped off by flying glass.”
“REALLY???!!”
“Poor Puss had a nervous twitch after that. I remember accidentally letting a swarm of bees into our house once.”
“You’re making this up!”
“No I’m serious, still don’t know how I did it but I went to see my dad’s hives in his allotment and they got out and followed me home.”
“Got out or you forgot to close the hive?”
“Erm well not forgot really… I just…”
“Thinking about it Daddy that does sound like something you would do. Leaving something open by accident.”
“God! You’re right!”
“Bet Mummy wasn’t as bad as us!”
“Oh yeah! Get this… Mummy ran away from Granny and Grandpa’s cottage for two days and they found her stealing iced buns from the village bakery.”
“HA!! Why have you never told me this before?”
“Mainly because we didn’t want to give you any ideas for future incidents and we’re trying to be good parents and grown ups.”
“You are! You are the best parents I could ever hope for… even if you are REALLLLLY ANNOYING SOMETIMES!!”
“Parents are meant to be annoying and embarrassing. How else are we going to get any enjoyment out of it?”
“Hehe! Love you Daddy. And thank you for finally listening.”
“My pleasure. Just maybe try listening to us now and again as well. Who knows we might both learn something.”
“Yeahhhh…. maybe.”

,"Adventure, Fiction, Kids","I look down from the stage and remember it all began because we survived.  I can see it all and remember every word.
 
“Who do we have here?” Come, children. Gather up your pets and follow me. We need to get to know one another. I see we have a couple of you who were crying. Here is some tissue. We will get everything sorted out and there will be no more tears.
“I am Jane. I want each of you to introduce yourselves and then sit down until everyone has been introduced.
I am Rufus and this is my sister Red. My best friend is my Redheaded Woodpecker named Knock, Knock. My sister’s best friend is a tiny elephant shrew, who is also red-headed like us.
“Red, do you want to say anything?”
“No, Rufus, talks.”
“Look up at me Red, I can hear you better when you look up at me. I know Rufus talks but I would love to hear you say something.”
“Oh, My.” What was that?
The elephant shrew stuck out his tongue and gave us all a wet raspberry sound. Red repeated his answer.
We all had a laugh. “That was a very good and funny sound. Maybe you will feel more like talking later.
“Hi, I am Lucas.”
“Hi, I am Luna. Lucas is my brother. My best friend is a feathered hen. Lucas likes his beaded goat.”
“I, have a blue duiker. My name…Kipke. My sister is Chebet. She has a bat-eared fox. We sing.”
“That is wonderful Kipke. I am sure you will get to sing for us if you want to, at another time. It would also help if you would speak up just a little. Sometimes I don’t hear too good.” Good, he is grinning back at my wink.
“This is Chiquita. She is a good swimmer and a good dog. She loves me. I am Aimee. My brother is Alejandro. His buddy is Lopez, an iguana.”
“Now that we have everyone’s names we can talk and get to know one another. Does anyone know why you are here together?”
“The boat we were working on went down in the last storm. Someone put us on another longboat with our animals and covered us with a huge cloth. This is where we washed up.”
“That is right, Rufus. We will have to set up camp and build a fire to let any rescuer know where we are. Then we will each have to find a way to confine our pets so they can be fed and watered. Does anyone know what happened to your parents?”
“I saw the stage get hit with the big stack from the ship. All our parents were on stage at the time. I do not think we have parents anymore.”
“That is what I saw as well, Red. I am truly sorry about that. It is a sad day. But we are here together. We need shelter, food, and some time to figure out what to do. Can we do that?”
“Jane,”
“Yes, Lucas.”
“Do, you have a best buddy? We all do. Are you alone?”
“No, I am not alone. I have a miniature donkey named Daisy, a squirrel named Rosey, a Parrot named Sebastian, and A tree frog named Freddie.
I pulled Aimee into my lap and gave her another tissue. “They are safely on the other side of the shed over there. I wanted to make sure none of your pets would eat one of mine, so I left them other there until we got the introductions out of the way.
“Are there any other grown-ups that got off the boat?”
“We don’t know that yet, Kipke. That is why we need to visit each side of this little island and figure out if anyone else has washed ashore.”
“Why are you here?”
“Well, my pets had an act in the show too. I am an animal trainer and helped book this show on cruise lines around the world. This is the first time I left with more questions than answers.”
“We will have to figure it out as we go.”
“That is right, Chebet.”
“I do not want anyone to go off alone. Everyone must keep their pets with them and at least one other person. I have gathered noise makes for all of us. We will all hear the noise each one makes then when we hear that noise, we will follow it to wherever you are.”
“Good idea, you clever for an old person, Jane.”
I grinned at the brood before me. Hoping they did not hear my knees knocking and my hips creaking. I just did not have time for arthritis today. “I have my moment.”
“Let’s hear some noises.”
“Kipke, that was beautiful. Wow, you and Chebet can surely sing. I can hear those notes just a clear as a bell. I don’t think you need a noisemaker.”
“Jane, I think if I had a block of wood, Knock, Knock could make a pecking noise real loud too.”
“Wow, he sure can. Rat-a-tatt, Rat-a-tatt. Can everyone hear that?”
“Feathered hens don’t make much noise. But I can use this old bell and a rock. The clapper inside is gone but I think with a shoestring, I can make one.”
I sat there and watched these wonderful children work together to find solutions and to help each other. Before the day was half gone the kids were holding hands and making their way around to where the boat was washed ashore. The Iguana was riding the bearded goat and the Blue Duiker was following the bat-eared fox. The elephant shrew was in Red’s shirt pocket. Rufus held his block of wood upon his shoulder so Knock, Knock could peck away at it. 
Here I am one lone grandmother. I laugh when I say that. I never gave birth to a child. My last husband had all the kids. I did not get to be a grandmother until I married him. That was such fun. I did enjoy my school teaching years though. It looks like it was good training for whatever it is I am in the middle of now. One day at a time. One thing is for sure. Hope is alive and well… so far.
The bell, I hear the bell… Knock, Knock is making his noise. Here we go…. Such much noise.
Daisy, saw me coming and slowly made her way to me. She let me lean on her as we worked our way towards the noise that had now escalated into dog barks, Sebastian’s whistle, and some sort of squeal.
“What is this.” I stood there as two men pulled themselves to shore. One with a rifle and another with a hatchet. Their clothes were half torn from them. I recognized them from the gally of the ship. I glanced behind them and saw two women pulling a tarp with things piled upon it. “Who are you? What do you think you are going to do with that gun?
“We are going to eat something lady. One of these kids will do or one of the critters. We do not care. We have been trailing water for miles.”
“Shouted as loud as I could. DAISY, NOW, DAISY HARD.”
Daisy trotted around the outside of the now circle made by the other adults. She turned her back and kick the man with the gun as hard as she could. When it fell to the ground, the dog grabbed it. I took it from the dog. I then smashed it as hard as I could on the ground.
The man was still unconscious on the ground. I looked at the other man and decided he was too weak to be a threat. The two ladies were maids, but they had gathered pots, pans, and things from the galley before getting into the boat they used to escape. “We were just hungry mom. We weren’t goin’ ta eat no kid. Really.”
“Well, you best tie this guy up until we can educate him on surviving without eating anyone we know.”
I was glad to see other adults but am not sure my task is any lighter. We now have two women, two men, and me. Eight children and twelve pets. I chucked. Sounds like the beginning of a new village. Who knows?
“We continue to work on shelter and food. Let’s all meet over by the only shed on the island. We can look around to see how we can expand it. Then we need to gather firewood and build a large pit to use for signal fires and cooking. We need someone to look for other vegetations.”
We found logs. Daisy and the goat helped drag them to a makeshift campsite. We found some coconuts, bananas, and other assorted melons and fruits. The kids had fun creating fishing poles and searching for the crawdads to use as bait.
I hear Sebastian’s whistle and knock, knock at it again. You would not believe what just floated ashore. A stage. Complete with curtains, ropes, flooring, and all. It had been blown away from the ship and landed in a lifeboat all by itself. There were no people on board, just the stage.
Our two men finally came around. The knot on the back of his head pretty much told him how he came to be unconscious. He did not apologize for his remarks or his attitude. I could see there were some more battles ahead with this one.
I looked around. The sun was setting and streaked the water with reds and purples. We were all safe and sound sitting on the logs that surrounded a huge fire. We were all full of fish, bananas, fruit. We were all dry. As I gave a little prayer to the powers that be I took a deep breath. The animals were all with their respective keepers. Then each and every brother and sister did a number on the stage as if it were supposed to be that way. We did eight curtain calls. They sang, they danced, performed with their pets. Separately and together. I could see new acts beginning and friendships forging.
Our life cycle takes us through at least six stages of life. From the fetus, baby, child, adolescent adult, and elderly. I looked at one of the maids and knew we had the fetus stage with us too. All six stages in life were accounted for right here.
We are all going into a stage or coming out of a stage. We are all preparing for our next stage. We are here to prepare each one for its next stage.
Just think… eight curtain calls. Right here in one little village. The adventure will continue until our little group is ready to perform for the world. We are going to have some acts that will knock your socks off….
I think there is enough love and hope to keep it all working together. We have a good smattering of nationalities as well. We have redheads from Ireland, blonds from Sweden, Brown-haired from Cuba, and Hazel eyes from Kenya. No one has said a single word about their differences. They seem to be excited about how much they can teach one another.
“I have to laugh out loud right now.” The elephant shrew is at the front of the stage… Tongue sticking out… doing his best balloon fart he can.” Red has made him a mega-phone with a cone she made. It makes it louder. Oh, what fun. Now everyone is doing raspberries.
Even the cannibal among us is now laughing and doing one too. “I hope that is a sign that things will be fine.”
I noticed some odd trails in the sand when we were gathering those logs. Someone else is either on the island and either still here or long gone. I will let my curiosity work on that one overnight. We still have oodles to explore. Even more to discover. There the kids go. Singing again. It sure is pretty. What good sports they all are. Orphans all of us. All at different stages in our lives. All in this together. I am so sleepy.
Hope Village of The Performing Arts. Already had eight curtain calls. I know now we will all be rescued eventually. When the acts are ready to take another stage and even more curtain calls. This short story will be expanding to document the adventure. Come follow us as we grow.",Stages and Curtain Calls
,"Friendship, Kids, Fiction","“And it’s showtime!”
 
Stegatha, the stellar Stegosaurus stomped onto the stage. She was nervous to sing on a stage for the first time but was also confident in her musical ability.
 
When she looked out at all the dinosaurs in the audience, down from the stage, she froze.
 
“I don’t know if I can do this!” She thought and began to shake from nerves.
 
Al the aggressive Allosaurus, growled, watching this unfold from the wings of the stage. He didn’t know how long he could watch Stegatha flounder out there. She looked positively petrified. 
 
“Should I just grab her and refund all the dinos from Prehistoric Town?” He considered, but he wasn’t going to do that. He was the biggest, baddest dino around and to do that would show weakness.
 
Instead, and even though he had been friends with Stegatha for his whole life, he shouted, “Stegs, it’s go time! Get singing!” 
 
Al and Stegatha’s friendship seems unlikely, but it began many years ago while they were both very young. Stegatha was a few years older than Al, and when they were dino kids she was quite a bit bigger than him. When other dinosaurs came to scrap with Al, Stegs would protect him. Her spiked tail came in handy as defense against dino-bullies coming after Al.
 
Unfortunately some of those bullies had grown up into full grown predators and they were bearing teeth in the audience, scaring an already shell-shocked Stegatha even more, and no amount of prodding by Al was doing any good.
 
“Get off the stage!” A testy Torvosaurus yelled, “I came for a show and you’re wasting my time!”
 
“You’re lucky we ate already, Stegatha, because at this point, we’d put you out of your misery!” Shouted the ornery patriarch of a family of Orintholestes.
 
“Well, I haven’t eaten yet, and if you don’t start singing soon, I’ll rip you to shreds!” Threatened a particularly ravenous Creatosaurus.
 
Apparently that was the last straw for Stegatha. It isn’t clear what was worse being heckled by her predators or just the humiliation of it all but a single tear began to fall and although, he had his pride, that was too much for Al to bear. He raced onto the stage to break Stegatha’s frozen state. THE ICE AGE WAS NOT HAPPENING TODAY!
 
“Come here, Stegs,” Al said, putting a claw on her back.
 
Still partially frozen in place, she opened her mouth with eyes closed, trying to overcome her stage fright but nothing came out.
 
It was heart-breaking for Al to watch his friend struggle so, but it only egged those cold blooded dinosaurs in the audience on.
 
“Just give it up, Stegatha. We don’t know what we expected from a gentle plant-eater like you! You clearly need to work on your bravery. Go back to the jungle where you belong and go eat some LEAVES!” an especially mean Marshosaurus cackled.
 
That was it for Stegatha, and she fled. The makeshift auditorium erupted with laughter.
 
“Grow up you buffoons!” Al boomed and stomped off. He wasn’t reimbursing anyone. They had gotten their entertainment from all the jeering and he told them as much before going to comfort his friend. He knew where she’d be.
 
As Al stalked through the jungle to where his friend was, he grabbed an ornithopod that was taking a quick rest and ate it before it even got out a screech. He was more mad than hungry. Angry at his peers for finding humor in his friend’s evident pain. Sure, they were carnivores but did they have to be so blood-thirsty? Maybe he was the odd one for befriending someone that was ordinarily prey.
 
Getting even more frustrated, he yelled at a Brachiosaurus to get out of his way. The Brach made a mad dash - he didn’t want to end up being dinner.
 
Soon, Al turned a corner and could hear sobs. Stegatha was underneath a giant tree crying to herself. The giant tree with its weeping branches nearly eclipsed the sorrowful dino. This was a tree that Al and Stegatha always found themselves at when they needed to get away from danger or just the world at large. It was a kill or be killed world back then even for a predator like Al. He wasn’t always as big as he is now. Plus, it made for a great spot for hide and seek when they were kids.
 
“Don’t worry about them. You know what they’re like. Don’t take it to heart.” Al said soothingly.
 
“I do! And that’s the problem. I choked like I always do! I wanted to get out there and show this town what I’m made of. That even though I’m not a rough and tough killer that I can sing a great tune and that I matter. These dinosaurs have made me feel weak and meaningless my whole life and my singing voice is the one thing that’s been giving me strength and making me feel confident.”
 
Al felt puzzled. He had heard Stegatha sing many times in front of him when it was just the two of them. What had changed? He supposed it may have had to do with more dinosaurs in the audience than just him or that some of those dinosaurs hadn’t been very kind to Stegatha as a younger dinosaur and throughout her life. Maybe it had to do with being the center of attention with all those eyes on her. Al had always admired her and never regarded her as a pushover like all the rest. He’d even seen her defend him against predators using her spiky tail like a vicious bat! He just needed her to know how much her friendship meant to him. Maybe that would turn this around.
 
“Stegs,” Al said gently over cries that had quieted down. She slowly looked up.
 
“I want you to see yourself the way I see you not like how those bullies see you. I want you to remember how you looked out for me when you found me all my own when I was separated from my group of other Allosauruses. I never forgot that and even when I was reunited with my kind, we remained friends. My group also respected how even though we are predators of yours, you didn’t let fear get the better of you, you didn’t fear that my family would hunt you, all you did was show me kindness and protection. When we were older and larger dinosaurs would try to come after me, you’d defend me. You are so, so brave, Stegatha. Don’t ever let these bullies make you feel weak just because you’re a herbivore and you’re in the minority here. There’s nothing weak about you.”
 
Stegatha was silent for a couple moments. Her tears had stopped and it appeared as if she was letting all of Al’s powerful words in.
 
“I want to try again,” she replied.
 
Al wasn’t so sure if this was a good idea. What if they laughed at her even more? What if they didn’t even give her a chance once she got out there and she never sang again, but he didn’t want to dissuade her.
 
Instead he said, “OK, I will set it up.”
 
Al spread the word and resisted the urge to maim every dinosaur who laughed in his face and said of course they’d be back to watch Stegatha fail again. If he killed every dinosaur who did that, he’d be the only one as her audience like before her big debut.
 
Soon, the night was before them and the words, “it’s showtime!” Left his lips once more. 
 
Stegatha emerged on the stage and of course, the audience was a cacophony of jeers and cruel laughter. Stegatha turned to Al who was watching from the wings and she took a deep breath and closed her eyes and began to sing. A hush fell over the entire audience. They had never heard such beautiful singing and Stegatha had never believed in herself more.",Stegatha and Al
,"Friendship, Kids, Science Fiction","It was an important day for the sisters at Critter Cove. They had to get ready for their very first Tea party with the Princess. Abbie, the oldest, had put out a white round table with crystal clear tea cups and thin silver spoons, the perfect size for tea sugar cubes. The warm humming light from the candles she had placed at the center of the table shined ever so slightly off the spoons and tea cups. Using her fluffy tail to dust off the mushroom chairs around her table she sighed with relief. One table down, one to go. Turning around to see if her sister Sarah had finished her table. Her eyes were met with so many colors that they almost bled together. Pink drapes hung off the table with purple paper plates and yellow roses at the center of the table. Wooden stick chairs that seemed to be hand made circled the color popping table. This was not what Abbie wanted for the Princess. She was sure the princess needed perfection and this was not it.
Sarah skipping out of the kitchen holding muffins with pink sprinkles noticed Abbie staring at her table. Looking passed her she seen Abbie's table. It was so plain and neat looking. No color or joy was met by that table. She hated it and knew the princess wouldn't have any fun at that table. As Abbie disappeared to the closet, where all their decorations were, Sarah decided to put the Muffins on Abbie's table. She thought at least this would bring some color to this boring tea party. Happy with her work she went back to the kitchen to get more Muffins for her table.
Abbie had to get something for Sarah's table. It was so messy and just not fit for a princess. Looking through all their supplies she found a beautiful napkin set. It sparkled white and had diamonds on the edge stitching. This would make it look a little better she thought as she grabbed them and went to Sarah's table. Placing them ever so gently on each purple paper plate. Proud of adding some perfection to the table she looked at the time. The princess would be there any minute. She needed to bring the tea out fast. Turning to run to the kitchen a sparkle hit the corner of her eye from her table. Unsure of what would be so shiny on her table she looked closer and seen Sarah's Muffins with pink shinning sprinkles. ""No no no."" she thought. ""This will ruin my table!"" Grabbing the muffins she spun around to put them back in the kitchen when she tripped on her own tail. Sending the muffins flying in the air and landing on Sarah's table. Muffins and pink sparkles scattered everywhere on Sarah's table and chairs. Frantically, looking at the clock, she realized she had no time to clean up. The princess needed at least one table and it wasn't going to be that one. She got up and ran into the kitchen to grab the Tea Kettles passing by Sarah as she brought out more Muffins. Walking up to her table Sarah noticed the huge mess all over the place. Her table was covered in broken muffins. Upset with her sister ruining her table, she grabbed one end of her table and started to push it where Abbie's table was. The lighting was better there maybe it would save her table from the disaster her sister made.
Coming out of the kitchen Abbie saw Sarah pushing her table out of the spot light. With a huff Abbie ran over placing down the tea kettles on her table. She began to push her table back into the light. Now Abbie and Sarah were pushing their tables back and forth wanting to have the best table spot for tea with the princess. The drapes on Sarah's table began to tear as she pushed harder. Abbie's crystal tea cups fell over and some even rolled onto the floor breaking. Getting more and more upset the two sisters were about to push even harder when the princess walked in.
Tall and slender the princess walked in with a blue long dress covered in diamonds that flowed down to the floor. A top her head was a crown with purple and pink sparkling crystals. Hands folded above her waist she walked over to the sisters. The two sisters jumped from their tables as they seen the princess and looked down at what they did. Embarrassed and upset they turned away from each other. The princess smiled and walked passed them grabbing one of the homemade chairs Sarah had made just for the tea party. She then walked over to the tables placing the chair in the middle of both tables. Brushing muffins off the chair she sat down and grabbed one of Abbie's crystal tea cups. The princess liked both the tables and seen how upset the sisters were. Clearing her throat she reached across the table trying to grab one of Sarah's muffins. Peaking over her shoulder Sarah seen the princess trying to grab one of her muffins. Spinning around she helped the princess and got her one. Smiling the princess motioned her to take a seat with her. 
As Sarah slid over a chair to sit down, Abbie turned around to see the princess holding her crystal tea cup as she poured tea in it from the tea kettle. The princess looked up at her and then looked down at one of Abbie's mushroom chairs. Abbie grabbed her mushroom chair and sat down at the table. Looking around at the huge mess the two sisters have made the princess started to laugh. Abbie looked at Sarah tilting her head. Sarah looked down at the table grabbing one of Abbie's crystal tea cups that had rolled to her side of the table. Laughing she looked up at Abbie and said, ""Your crystal tea cup fits perfectly on my table."" Smiling at Sarah, Abbie grabbed a muffin from her side of the table. ""Your muffins do bring light to my table."" The princess then raised her crystal tea cup and said, ""Tea anyone?"" They all laughed and poured each other tea. Spending the rest of their day eating muffins and planning out their next tea party together.",Terrific Tea Table
,"Coming of Age, Kids, Drama","As soon as the microwave beeped, Katie withdrew the steaming hot mug of water from it and gently closed the door. She whipped out a bag of fragrant chamomile tea and plunked it into the mug. It immediately soaked up the water and unleashed its pungent yet fruity aroma right under her nose. She inhaled deeply, smiling even though she was very anxious. For pure sensory relaxation, nothing beat a cup of good chamomile tea.
Katie began adding a small spoonful of honey to her tea, stirring it around inside the cup with a long-handled spoon. All the while she was thinking of her daughter sitting upstairs. She had to tell her. Sophie was ten years old and she could not keep such things from her. Sooner or later she would find out. The sooner she was informed, the better she would be able to take the news. And better for her to hear it directly from her mother than offhand from somebody else.
Once she was satisfied that the tea had seeped enough into the water, Katie removed the bag from the cup with her spoon, and took a tiny sip. Very, very hot, but also quite soothing as it went down her throat. She sat there for a moment, blowing on the surface of the liquid, waiting for it to cool. Once the temperature was slightly lower, she took a larger sip. She smiled slightly. It was pleasing enough to her tongue to almost soothe her emotions about what she was about to tell her daughter.
On paper, whether to tell her was a no brainer. But Katie was still in agony over it as she walked up the stairs to her daughter’s bedroom. 
 
She got up, teacup in hand, and walked slowly toward and then up the stairs. Tears ran down her cheeks, and her heart thumped like crazy as she reached the top of the steps and looked down the hall to her little girl’s room. The door was closed. It made Katie feel even more nervous. She couldn’t see her daughter at that moment, couldn’t see how she was doing. Was she doing her homework? Was she doing something enjoyable? 
Katie marched over to the door, took another sip of tea to steel her nerves, and took a deep breath. 
Before her mind could delay her any further, her hand reached out and knocked on the door.
“Come in,” said the voice from outside.
Katie stood in front of the door, frozen. She couldn’t move. Hearing her daughter’s voice gave her pause.
“Come in,” the voice said again, sounding slightly irritated.
The door at last opened, and Katie entered the room. She was relieved to see that Sophie was sitting on her bed cradling one of her stuffed animals and looking forward. She was not engaged in any particularly meaningful activity that was about to be disrupted.
“Sophie,” Katie said as she closed the door behind her. “There’s something that I need to tell you, sweetie.”
“Oh?” The little girl looked straight at her, her facial expression not changing at all.
“Sophie sweetie,” Katie sat on the bed next to her daughter, “your dad and I have been having some problems lately. Today we have started the process of getting a divorce.”
Sophie’s eyes shot open slightly. “A – a divorce?”
“Yes,” Katie answered, clearing her throat and placing her hand on Sophie’s shoulder. “We think it really is for the best. I know that this is going to be tough for you. But we want you to know that both your parents love you very, very much.”
Sophie sat silently for a moment, still not reacting visibly to the news. Katie wondered if she was just taking time to process it all.
“Are you okay, sweetie? If you have any questions, please ask away.”
“Why are you and Dad having problems?” Sophie asked, looking down at the bed.
“Sometimes it just happens between adults. People change over the years. People have their differences and they can’t always be reconciled.”
“Are we all going to live in different houses now?”
“Well, your Dad and I will be living separately, yes. We haven’t figured out where you will live yet. You probably will switch back and forth between our houses.”
Sophie sat in silence, still staring down at the bed. She didn’t look very sad, didn’t look like she was going to cry, but she didn’t seem to like the news much either.
“Would you like a sip of tea, sweetie?”
“No thanks. I don’t like hot tea.” Sophie continued to stare straight ahead. “This is – this is going to be different.”
“Yes, it is. But it will work out okay. Lots of kids go through this. We will do everything we can to help you adjust. Your dad and I both want what’s best for you.”
“Okay,” Sophie moved her head back up, and hugged her stuffed animal closer.
Katie stretched her arm over Sophie’s shoulders and hugged her. “Are you going to be okay, baby? Is there anything I can do for you?”
“No – not right now. I think I would like to go to sleep.”
“Okay. Get into your PJs. I’ll come back in a few minutes to check on you.”
“Sounds good Mom, thanks,” Sophie said as Katie walked out of the room and closed the door behind her. A tear dripped down her face as she breathed a small sigh of relief. She walked back down to the living room, picked up the remote and switched the TV on. Things were going to be trying from that point on, but the absolute worst was over and now she needed to relax by herself. She still had her herbal tea with her and that would help.
Inside the bedroom, Sophie reached for her phone that was sitting on her bedside table. She dialed a few numbers then held it to her face.
“Sophie? Is that you?” the voice on the other end asked.
“Ricky, you owe me twenty bucks. You lost. I told you it would happen. I knew that sooner or later my mom would find out that my stupid dad likes to fuck pool boys. Yeah, yeah, I know. It still sucks though. I sure could go for some hot tea right now.”",Just Rip the Bandage Off
,"Fiction, Friendship, Kids","“The way to man’s heart is through a cup of tea” - anonymous
The sun glared down at Aaron and Tommy, who stood in the midst of tufts of unkempt grass, whispering. Their eyes held a glint of mischief, as the heat beat down on them. Their gestures were big, and their smiles even bigger. They looked and acted like kings, kings who owned the backyard at least, and I was curious. Curious to their minds, which often brought them trouble. They were often confined to the backyard by my parent’s or Tommy’s because of the incident last summer when they had thought it a decent idea to steal oranges from Penny’s backyard. Penny had, of course, retaliated and snitched on them, which caused Tommy and Aaron to fill her jacuzzi with orange juice, and had earned both of the boys a punishment. Our moms knew the only way to keep the boys in order was by locking them away in our backyard, where they could only cause trouble to themselves. 
Auntie, obviously, had told me to keep my nose away from them because they wouldn’t give me anything but consequences, but it never occurred to me that I should actually listen to her. So as I waited for the water on the stove to boil, I watched Aaron and Tommy through the sliding door. My breath stained the clear glass, and it seemed to me that they were living a better life than me, and I wanted to live it, so I constantly watched them. 
Aaron had explained to me on more than one occasion that it was because he was my elder and had lived a good two years more than me that he had more fun than I did. He told me that I simply hadn’t lived long enough and didn’t deserve fun, yet. That I had to wait to go through trials and tribulations, which I, at the time, thought it meant adventures like in 
, before I could earn the prize of fun. Until then, I couldn’t play with him and Tommy, which hadn’t given me much of a bother in the past. I had grown accustomed to living with excitement through both of the boys.
But as the water began to boil, my eyes fixated on Tommy’s smile. I was growing restless. I couldn't handle watching them laugh. I couldn't handle their contagious happiness that seemed to spill over the edges. I needed to understand it.
I had never known someone to smile as much as Tommy, and the fact he was smiling because he was having fun with another child was alien to me. The kids at school had made me nervous and sweaty, and the other fourth graders often made rude comments, so I didn’t say anything to any of them. Much less smile at them. I wondered what it would be like if I tried to smile at them, whisper secrets, and play with them.
The kettle whistled. I whistled along. It was a melody. A sweet one. It matched the energy around me; nervous, as if something electrical was about to occur. 
I wanted to understand. I wanted to understand how a child could have so much fun with another child, and not end the play date by crying. I wanted to be like Aaron and Tommy, who were magnets to other children. I wanted to know what it felt like to connect with others in my class, but I couldn’t. 
The kettle’s whistle quieted to the low hum of a person with a secret. That’s what it was like when I tried to talk to others. I wasn’t heard. My heart always beat too fast, and my mind strung through incoherent phrases, which I later learned was called anxiety. Social anxiety to be more exact, and at such a young age I didn’t know how to cope with it. I thought myself to be a freak. 
Mother used to question me and my obsession with watching Aaron through the sliding door. She said that Sisi’s father had just built a new tree fort, and I could go over anytime, but I was quite content merely watching Aaron and Tommy. Auntie claimed it was because I was a lazy child and maybe part of that was true, whatever the case I didn’t feel like explaining. I didn’t feel like explaining that the only comfort I would feel with other children was with Aaron and Tommy, and it was because I was sure I was their friend. I had kept my eye on them long enough to feel like I knew them, and I was positive that made me a freak. How could you become friends with another person by simply watching them?
The water boiled over the top, and sizzled as drops of water popped into the fire.
Why had it taken me months of watching two children before I felt comfortable speaking to them, especially when one of them was my brother? Shouldn't it be easier? Shouldn't I be able to ask Sisi if she wants to be my friend, and be over with it?
The steam shot through the top of the kettle.
Freak. Was that what I was to be forever? 
The kettle whistled. The water boiled. I slowly turned. My eyes found the barking kettle that was running on all fours. I tilted my head. Surely there was a reason why the kettle was acting up. It was because of the fire. Someone had to turn the fire down. Maybe my fire was burning too bright and I had to dial it back before it made me boil over the top, before it made me approach Aaron and Tommy, and ask them a simple question.
Maybe Aaron wanted tea, I knew Tommy liked tea.  Tea would be a nice conversation starter. I could tell Tommy and Aaron I wanted to be their friends. I could tell them I was tired of being a bystander.
My fire was burning too bright, and my mind was moving too fast as I was sure there was steam coming through my ears.
Was it right to ask to be their friends? Would they be scared? I knew so much about them, did they even bat an eye at me? My fire burned bright. I would just have to find out.
Carefully, I turned the stove off, and poured the scalding water into three cups, filling them with a Yorkshire tea that my mom loved. 
The fire inside of me was warm, and at the peak of its heat. 
I placed the mugs together on a tray decorated with floral patterns, and balanced the tray in my hands. The tray felt warm, a fuel to my fire. 
I walked slowly out of the kitchen, my feet padding against the wood floor.
I cautiously turned to the sliding door, and my fire went out. Everything was pitch black. The electricity stopped, and the steam blew off. There was no one in the backyard. Aaron and Tommy had climbed the fence too escape their punishment a minute too early.
I didn’t know what to feel. A part of me felt relieved. And another part of me silently wondered if this was how it was to be between me and Aaron and Tommy. Them living. Me living through them vicariously. Relying on them to feel for me by watching them enjoy every second of life through our sliding door. Maybe it was better they were gone. It was safe inside the house. No one could reject me behind the sliding door, and it was always better to be safe.
I set the mugs down, and drank my tea. I could be my own friend. Maybe one day Aaron and Tommy would try to come and play with me. I'd say yes. They’d only have to ask me to a cup of tea, and that would seal the deal. 
The way to my heart was not through their silly games or infectious laughter, the way to my heart would be through a cup of Yorkshire tea.",Through the Sliding Door
,"Funny, Kids, Friendship","Becky slipped ‘Little Girl Etiquette,’ under her seat cushion. Last minute cribbing wouldn’t do. The chapter on tea parties taught her so much. 
This would be her first tea party. She planned for perfection.
The white garden table, set with dainty cups and saucers, looked exactly like the picture in her book. Her mother provided fresh cookies and juice (pretend tea), for her guests to sip. She adjusted a napkin and placed the plastic spoon, just so.
She only needed Antonia, Cindy and their companions to arrive. Becky’s favorite Barbie doll already sat at the table. Several cushions elevated her to table level, where she could enjoy the festivities. 
“Are you comfy, Barbie? Anything I can get you?”
Barbie said, “Math is hard.”
Becky smiled. “Your friend Dolly should be here soon.” Barbie smiled.
Dolly was Cindy’s favorite doll. Cindy’s older sister, Antonia would also come. Becky hoped she wouldn’t bring that grumpy, stuffed panda, Tony. ‘
’ she thought. ‘
.’
Standing tall, she announced to the garden, “We’ll have no obstreperous guests. Not on my watch.” She thought, ‘
’ But it seemed to fit.
Her mother waved from the window. 
Becky said, “I’ll be right back,” and ran into the house. 
Inside, Becky’s mother chatted with the girls and their mother. Antonia and Cindy held Tony and Dolly, who appeared to dance when Becky came in. Cindy’s mother wished them a fun party and left.
Becky glanced at Tony. ‘
’ She said, “Everything’s ready. Let’s go.”
The three little girls giggled and ran outside with their toys in tow. They situated Dolly and Tony in their chairs and the girls sat beside them. 
Becky welcomed everyone. 
“Who wants tea?” She began to pour ‘tea’ into tiny cups from the flowered pot.
Antonia asked, “Do you have iced tea?” Becky looked confused. “I’m sorry, but Tony dislikes hot tea.”
“Well, this isn’t actually hot.” She whispered, “It’s really apple juice. Is that okay with Tony?”
“But it’s actually that Tony doesn’t like the kinds of people who frequent tea parlors.”
Cindy said, “But we’re in a garden, not…”
Becky said, “Antonia, please tell your obstreperous bear that he came to a tea party. Why did he come, if he doesn’t want to socialize over a refreshing drink?”
Cindy said, “I heard tea parties have a long tradition in polite society.”
Antonia continued. “He thinks they’re opium dens for lightweights.”
Cindy asked, “What’s opium?”
No one answered. 
Becky tried to regain control. “Tony is so sophisticated. Such big words for a panda.”
“We’re very proud of Tony. He’s traveled the world. A very astute bear.”
Becky refilled cups and offered the cookie plate. 
Cindy grabbed two. “Dolly wants one too.”
Becky said, “He must like tea, though. Pandas are from China. Doesn’t China have lots of tea?”
Antonia shook her head. “Tony favors bamboo. He says he wouldn’t trade a plate of bamboo for all the tea in China…”
Becky looked to Cindy for support. “How are you today, Dolly? Thank you for coming.”
Cindy said, “Dolly loves these cookies. Did you make them?”
“No. I can’t make cookies without Mom’s help, yet. She got them from a bakery.”
“Can Dolly have another?”
“Of course, she may. Take two. And here’s more tea for you.” Becky filled the tiny cups.
“Dolly says ‘thank you, Becky.’”
“You’re very welcome, Dolly.” 
Becky looked around the table. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. Except for Tony, who seemed to be glaring at her.
Becky leaned in. “Can I get you something else, Tony? Are you sure you wouldn’t like some tea?”
Antonia said, “He’s sure, Beck. He meant what he said.”
“You’re only putting words in his mouth, Antonia. Stop it.”
“You don’t think he can speak for himself?”
“Let him.” Becky looked at Tony. He sat silently. “See? Nothing to say.”
“Depends on who he’s talking to. I think his silence speaks volumes.” 
Barbie said, “Math is hard.”
Antonia continued, “Sometimes, the less said, the better.”
Becky said, “I have a surprise. I looked up how to read tea leaves. Who wants to go first?”
Cindy said, “Let Dolly.”
Becky leaned over the doll’s cup and murmured. “Hmmm… What do you see?”
“A dragon.”
“Really?”
“Yeah, on the side of the cup.”
“No. I mean the tea leaves. Do they suggest something to you?”
“I don’t see tea leaves. Isn’t it juice?”
“We’re pretending, Cindy.”
“Oh. Then Dolly says she sees… an elephant.”
“Very good. That means you have a good memory. And that you will travel to exotic places.” Becky looked at Tony. “Would you like me to read your tea leaves, Tony?”
Antonia said, “Tony doesn’t approve of necromancy.”
Becky couldn’t believe it. “Enough, Antonia. It’s not necromancy. I’m reading tea leaves.”
“Same thing.”
“No. It’s not.”
“He thinks you’re putting on airs.”
“Well I think he’s putting on hairs.”
“Hairs?”
“He needs a shave.”
“He’s a bear.”
“Oh, so, tell me. Are you putting on bears?”
“This is stupid, Becky. Are you putting me on? I’m not a bear.” 
“He’s not a bear either.”
“Actually, he’s a panda. You’re silly.”
“Well I think you’re silly. You and your elitist panda. With his big words.”
“Being sophisticated doesn’t make you an elitist.”
Becky leaned in. “Being a sack of kapok doesn’t make you a panda, either.”
Even the birds in the trees went silent at that. Tony glared. 
Antonia looked at Barbie, who may have giggled. She said, “Math is hard.”
Ignoring Barbie, Antonia pushed her plate away. “I can’t believe you would say that to a guest. Where did you learn manners?”
Becky stood. “Manners? Why would someone who doesn’t like tea, come to a tea party? It’s ridiculous.”
“We were invited. Remember?”
“You didn’t have to come.”
“I think it’s time to go.” Antonia stood and grabbed Tony. “Are we allowed to leave?”
Becky curtsied. “Be my guest…”
Cindy picked up Dolly. “Oops. Tea party’s over.” She grabbed a handful of cookies.
The trio marched to the house. Barbie stayed behind.
Becky’s mother looked surprised. “Tea party over already?” No one responded. “Well, I’ll drive you home.”
Antonia said, “That’s okay. It’s only a block. I have a key.”
“Alright. If you’re sure.”
Antonia and Cindy nodded. 
“Okay, then. Bye. Thanks for coming.” She looked at Becky.
Becky chirped, “Thanks guys. Come again.”
The girls left. 
Becky returned to the garden and the remains of her tea party. Perched atop her cushions, Barbie smiled. 
Becky sat and took a sip of her ‘tea.’ “That went pretty well. Don’t you think?”

 a cheerful voice behind me asks. 
	I turn my head around to see Isabelle with a cheerful expression on her face. 
	“What’s tonight?” I ask. 
	Isabelle laughs.  “What’s tonight? Maya’s surprise party! Come on, Sky! You’ve known about this for months!” 
	I blush, embarrassed. Now that Isabelle is reminding me, I totally remember getting the invitation three months ago! 
	“Oh. Right. Um… I’m sorry, I’m not going to be able to go,” I mumble. 
	“Why not?” Isabelle asks. “You RSVP’d “yes” the day after the invitations were sent!” 
	“Oh. Yeah. Something just came up… my grandma’s sick and she wants us to go visit her,” I say, trying to look sad. “I’m sorry I can’t come through. It would have been fun.”
	“Oh, well. That’s ok! I hope your grandma gets better!” Isabelle says and then skips away to the next table to remind everyone about the party. 
	I feel terrible for lying, but I’m so glad I won’t have to come to the party. I love Isabelle, and she’s so nice, but being around other people just drains me. Why can’t someone throw a party where all everyone does is read and sit outside on the back porch quietly?
	The bell rings, alerting everyone that our next class is in five minutes. I throw away my lunch and walk alone through the hallways to my next class.

my mother calls when I get home.
Great. I didn’t think about this. What would I tell my mom?
“Well, Mom, I wanted to talk to you about something,” I start, walking into the kitchen where my mother is sitting. She sees me and gestures for me to go out of the room. “What-” I start. She puts a finger to her lips and points to her screen. Oh. She’s in a meeting.
I roll my eyes and then walk out of the room, heading upstairs. I pull out my phone and almost cry when I see what’s on the notification page.
First, Isabelle texted me:
Then, the text below that is from my grandma, who is perfectly healthy! She says:
And finally, a text from my mom, which she must have written while she was on the meeting:
Oh great. Today is going to be fun!

 after getting Isabelle’s cookies from the front porch, and then sit down next to my mom.
“Sky, did you have something you needed to tell me?” she asks.
I try to come up with something in my head before I say something, but I can’t think of anything. I’ll just have to make it up as I go. “Well… I’ve been thinking. I’m only a freshman in high school. Aren’t I too young to go to a party where practically our whole school is going to be there?” I ask.
Mom rolls her eyes and says, “Sky. It’s not the whole school, you know this! It’s just a few people in your grade. And Isabelle’s parents are very responsible. They are making sure the party is very safe. It’s just a birthday party! There’s nothing to be worried about!”
I shrug. That was probably a stupid question. “Ok, fine. The real reason I don’t want to go is that I signed up for… babysitting the Gray’s kids. They asked me last week and I said yes, not remembering that I had the party tonight. I can’t just… not go on such short notice. Don’t worry, I already told Isabelle and she said it was fine.”
“I don’t believe you!” Mom exclaims.
“You don’t?” I ask.
“Sky this is great! You’re finally stepping out of your comfort zone! What time do you have to be there?” she asks.
“Um… 5:00, but I was thinking I’d just walk there. I mean, they only live five minutes away,” I say.
“Yes, but that’s driving. Walking would take an hour! We’ll leave at 4:45, so you can get there a little early to talk to the Grays,” Mom says, and then stands up to go to her bedroom.
What am I going to do? I can’t just get dropped off at the Gray’s house and then just pretend to babysit their kids!

He’ll be on his way back from work! I’ll tell him that… nope. I can’t do it. I can’t lie anymore. This is a disaster.
But I can’t just tell the truth now… they’ll be so mad at me…
I look back at my phone and tell Isabelle thanks for the cookies. I tell her that we just got to my grandma’s house and she loved them.
But what do I tell my grandma? I can’t tell them about babysitting the Grays! She knows them way too well and would text them, and then find out I was lying… So I text my grandma that I’m not able to go to the party because I got sick from someone at school today.
But when I send the text I suddenly regret it. She’s going to text my mom and ask how I’m doing, and then my mom’s going to find out and then… I’ll most likely be grounded for two weeks.
Whatever. What’s done is done.
I pack a bag of stuff for babysitting, and start to get excited, but then I remember that I’m not actually doing it. Just pretending.
At 4:45 we get in the car and drive to the Gray’s house.
“I’ll take you in. I want to go say hi to Sally,” my mom says and we start to walk up to their house.
“No, no! It’s ok! You know what, I just got a text from Mrs. Sally saying that they just left, and that the kids are waiting for me in the living room!”
“But their cars are still here-”
“They got an Uber! Bye mom!” I push her into her car and start walking up the driveway. When her car turns the corner, I run down the sidewalk, away from the Gray’s house, and pull out my phone to text my dad.
I ask him to come pick me up here. Instead of telling him any lies, I just tell him the truth.
10 minutes later, he comes and picks me up. He doesn’t look mad. Honestly, he looks like he’s been laughing!
“Dad… what’s so funny?” I ask.
“Well… it sounds like you’ve worked so hard to not go to a party, that you could have had fun at, and instead you’ve just created a whole series of lies! I’m sure you’ve learned your lesson,” he says, chuckling.
“Yeah. I guess I have. Hey Dad?” I ask.
“Yeah?”
“I know I asked you to take me home, but can you take me to Isabelle’s house? I think I’ll go to the party.”
“I was already going that direction,” he says.
I send apologies to Mom and Grandma and Isabelle, and they all forgive me.
The party was a lot better than I thought it would be, and I enjoyed it!
I’m never going to try to get out of going to one again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ","Introverts, Lies, and Parties"
,"Coming of Age, Contemporary, Kids","	The wave of heat from the house fire flushed Andy Fluke’s sweaty face. He stood, unblinking, with a blank stare, as the flames engulfed his home. Smoke and soot swirled through the air. Police officers set up barricades that kept the curious onlookers back. And out of danger. The firefighters worked feverishly, trying to bring the fire under control. 
While some firefighters operated the fire truck hoses and shot water streams at the flames, others used axes to chop down anything that could fuel the fire. The police and fire vehicles blocked off the street from both ends.
         Someone in the crowd yelled, “Did the Flukes make it out?”
         The officer shrugged. Then the question spread through the group.
         Someone yelled, “Where are the Flukes?” 
          The crowd chanted, “Where are the Flukes?”
         “Hey, wait a minute. There’s one of the fluke boys over there.”
         A group of people rushed over to Andy. As people gathered around, they began to bombard him with questions. 
         “Where’s your family, boy?”
         “Where’s your Dad, Mom, and Brother?”
         Someone reached down and grabbed him by the shoulder. “Did your family get out with you? Tell us! Tell us!”
         Andy stared vacantly. A police officer noticed a crowd forming around Andy. The officer walked over and asked, “What’s going on here? Who is this boy?”
	“He’s Andy Fluke. He and his family live in the house that burned down.” A woman said as she instinctively wiped Andy’s face with the bottom of her apron.
	“And who are you, Mame?” the officer asked.
	“Oh, I’m Mrs. Taylor. I live across the street. Doris Fluke is my best friend. Andy and my—”
	“Okay, thank you, Mame.” The officer placed his hand on Andy’s shoulder and asked, “Where are your parents.”
	Andy kept staring at his house.
	The officer bent down in front of him. “Andy. What happened to your parents?”
	Tears filled Andy’s eyes as he whispered, “I killed them.”
 
	As Dr. Abigail Marrero walked towards her office, her supervisor, Dr. Thomas, motioned her over.
	“Yes?”
“Dr. Marrero, may I see you in my office for a moment.”
“Of course, Sir.” 
	When Abigail stepped inside the office, her stomach tightened. Family Court Judge Tess Tally sat at the conference table. In Abigail’s twenty years of working in the Child Pyschiartriry Unit of the Children Protection Services of New York, only twice a sitting judge had paid an official visit.  Once, to reprimand someone,  the other, to terminate someone. 
	Abigail swallowed deeply. “Good morning, your honor.”
	“I’m sorry to intrude before you’ve enjoyed your coffee,” she said, glancing at the Starbuck’s Venti Caffe Americano Abigail held in her hand. “You’ve been an expert witness in my courtroom many times, and I’ve admired the way you’ve given testimony. So after my staff did a background check on you, I made my decision.” 
	“Your decision? About me?”
	“Yes, doctor, I tell you this in the strictest confidence. Have you heard of the 13-year-old Arsonist Andrew Fluke who has confessed to setting the fire that resulted in the death of his family?”
	“Yes, it’s been in the papers and on the internet.”
	“Yes, but what’s not in the media is the state attorney is contemplating charging Mr. Fluke as an adult..”
	Judge Tally paced the floor as she shook her head.
	“Correct me if I’m wrong, Your honor. Do you want me to decide Mr. Fluke’s mental competency? You know, I don’t think a child should be charged as an adult.”
	“Yes, Dr. Marrero, we’re aware of your feelings. But you are one of the state’s leading Abnormal Child Psychologists. Moreover, you have a reputation for being honest and fair. So your opinion will be invaluable.”
	Abigail licked her lips.
	“The state attorney and I agree you have the right mix of expertise and compassion. Please agree to examine the boy?”
	Abigail extended her hand. “I’ll do my best,  your honor.”
 
	Three hours later, at 11 o’clock, Andy Fluke was delivered to Abigail’s office. Having never seen him, Andy looked nothing like Abigail imagined.  In fact, she didn’t know he was Black. The Flukes, his family, were white. He was slight for a 13-year old.  He sat across from her dressed in Brooklyn’s Crossroads Detention Center uniform with his head bowed. His legs were crossed, hands folded in his lap. His hair was black, curly, and long. 
	“Good morning, Andy,”
	Head still bowed.
	“How have you been? My name is Doctor Marrero, and I’m here to talk to you. Would you mind talking to me?”
	With his chin pressed against his chest, he said in low tones, “I ain’t got nothing to say you or anybody.” 
	Abigail walked from behind her desk. She smiled at Andy’s corrections officer, who peered through the office door window. She leaned against the edge of her desk
	“I read your file, Andy. Up until now,  you had no prior incidents.  What happened?”
	“Nothing happened. I just killed them, that’s all.”
	“You just killed them for no reason. Oh, come on, Andy. You’re too smart for that. You had a reason. How did the Flukes treat you? They were mean and nasty, I bet. And Timothy, the older boy, probably bullied  you all the time, huh?”
	Andy’ssquirmed in his seat. He shoved his hands in his pockets.
	“Tim never bothered me. He was my big brother.”
	Abigail picked up his file. “It says here that they adopted you when you were one year old. Out of all the children in the orphanage, they picked you. They must have loved you a lot.”
	Andy pulled his hands out of his pocket and steepled them.
His breathing became heavy. He looked at Abigail.
         “Yeah, they did. My family did love me.”
         Abigail read from his file again. “You went to St. David’s High School. You have to be pretty smart to go there. And it says here you were a B-plus student. Pretty good.”
         Andy buried his face in his hands. 
         In a soothing voice, Abigail asked, “Well, if they were so good to you and treated you well, why did you kill them? I promise you’ll feel better if you tell me. Maybe, you’ll even be able to sleep at night.”
         Andy jumped up from his chair and shouted, ” I don’t deserve to sleep at night! I killed my father, mother, and brother!”
Nostrils flaring, Andy marched towards Abigail. ” I should have died in that fire!.”
 Now, they were nose-to-nose. “It’s my fault my family’s dead!”
         The burly correction officers burst into Abigaiils’ office. He grabbed Andy by the back of the collar and yanked him to the floor in one motion. 
         As he restrained Andy, he looked and asked Abigail, “You okay. Doc? Want me to take him back to Crossroads?”
         Andy laid on the floor and sobbed uncontrollably. Abigail leaned down to talk to him. “Andy, do you want to go back to Brooklyn? Or do you want to try again?”
	Andy nodded.
	“I’m going to ask the officer to let you up. But another outburst like that, and I’ll be forced to send you back to Crossroads. Do you understand?”
	Andy looked at her and nodded.
	“Are you sure, Doc?” The officer warned.
	“Yes, officer. I think Andy will keep his word.”
	“Okay, if you say so. But I’ll be right outside looking through the window. Just in case.”
	The officer lifted Andy and placed him in a chair. Abigail waited a few moments for Andy to compose himself. Then, Abigail pulled a seat closer to Andy.
	“Andy, may I ask you something?” Abigail asked while she offered Andy a tissue.
	Andy wiped his tears away and stammered, “Y-Yeah.”
	In a calm voice, Abigail asked, “Unfortunately, your parents died in that horrible fire. You say you killed your family? Did you set the fire?”
	Andy turned his eyes away and stared at the floor.
	Abigail leaned closer. “You see, Andy, the fire inspector’s believed the fire started in a faulty electrical outlet, a plug, in your house’s family room. They didn’t find any evidence of arson.”
	“I don’t care what they say. I killed them.”
	“Andy, your family died from smoke inhalation. Why do you think you killed them?”
	For a few moments, they looked into each other’s eyes. Then, suddenly, Andy collapsed onto Abigail’s lap.
	Abigail gave him a minute, then sat him up. “What happened, Andy?”
	Andy got up and stood behind his chair. “My dad smelled the smoke first. He ran to everybody’s bedroom to warn us. He yelled, “Let’s go, everybody!” 
	We had an escape route. We were leaving the house when I snuck back to my room to get my baseball cards. My family tried to find me, but there was smoke and fire everywhere. I heard my family calling for me, but I couldn’t find them. I got real scared. So, I ran out a different way. My family died looking for me! It’s my fault they died! I killed them!”
	Abigail rushed over to Andy to kept him from collapsing. 
	“It’s alright, Andy. It’s going to be alright now.”
	 Andy buried his face into Abigail’s shoulder. 
	Abigail gently led Andy back to his chair. 
	“Listen to me, Andy. I know you feel guilty about what happened to your family. Your family loved you. They wouldn’t want you to suffer. I’m sure they would tell you, Andy, it’s not your fault. ”
	“But I feel so guilty. I should have—””
	“I know, Andy. Guilt can make you feel bad, but Andy, what happened is not your fault..”
	“I ran out the—”
	Abigail reached down, pulled Andy to her, and said firmly, 
	“Andy, it’s not your fault.”
Abigail held Andy close and whispered,  “It’ll be okay.""
	“It’ll be alright, Andy. Let it out. And Andy, keep repeating, it’s not my fault.””",SAVING ANDY

The Bad Thing
Reedsy - Elemental  Contest Entry
8/20/2021
 
 
 
The boy's name was Joseph, that was the only information the detective had managed to get after a half hour or so of sharing the small interrogation room.  No last name, just Joseph.  The kid looked to be about 12, maybe 13, he wore his hair long and in need of a cut.  He was unkempt and filthy down to his blackened fingernails.  The beat cops picked him up walking alone on the train tracks, just after dawn this morning.  He had soot in his hair and he reeked of smoke, not cigarette smoke, but the heavy cloying scent of a much larger inferno.  Joseph looked and acted like a hundred other street kids Detective Marks had dealt with over his last five years or so on the force. The kid wore the required uniform of a permanent scowl and a chip resting on his shoulder, yet something in his eyes told Marks this kid was different. There was sadness there. 
 
He slid a cold can of Pepsi across the table at the kid before he opened his yellow legal pad and clicked his pen.  Joseph opened it and chugged it in seconds.  Maybe his throat was sore from breathing in all that toxic smoke that had billowed out of the charred remains of the small house on Garfield Street.  The firefighters were still at the site, soaking things down, ensuring the flames were out entirely. They needn't conduct a full investigation to determine this was arson. It was a sloppy job, the work of an amatuer.  Finding the kid so soon and so close to the crime scene was pure luck. It wasn’t as if the boy had made any real effort to ‘escape’, looking at him, one could tell he’d stayed to watch. 
 
Detective Marks had a dozen questions, but something told him not to rush this kid.  He looked rough, but Marks saw a kid, dirty, and small, sitting  in the chair across from him, hugging his knees, he could sense fear radiating from the boy.  
 
“So, is this your first time playing with matches”? The detective asked, hoping to break the ice and get the kid talking.  Despite himself, Joseph chuckled. “Yes sir” he answered, before regaining what he hoped was a cool demeanor. “Pretty big mess over there Joe”, Marks said as he pushed a few polaroids towards the boy. They weren’t the best pictures, but even an untrained eye could see that there was very little left to the structure.  
 
Without looking down at the photos, Joseph asked, “Is it gone then?”  “Like all of it? Did it all burn up?”  There was a desperate eagerness in his voice. “Everything but the basement stairs” the detective replied. Joseph winced a little hearing about the stairs. He began to wonder and worry if the stairs surviving would make a difference. 
 
He’d been very careful, taking his time, dousing every corner of that damned house with gasoline he’d stolen from a nearby garage. He’d gone to the basement, he soaked the old mattress and sofa that were stored down there, he splashed stacked cardboard boxes and whatever else he could think would burn.  He

 it to disappear. 
 
It had been  almost two years since the bad thing happened. The interior of the home, prior to Joseph lighting that bitch up, remained homey and lived in.  There were dishes in the sink, the dog dishes were still full, it was silent and dark in the hallway leading to the bedrooms.  The scattered belongings of two children were in sight.  Joseph had memorized this home well before he had come to destroy it.  He went there a lot. Sometimes he’d hook school and just sit in the dusty basement. He’d look at the photos on the wall and in albums kept under the coffee table. The family in the book was becoming harder for Joseph to remember clearly. 
 
Joseph had just turned ten when the bad thing happened, when they all left him.  A family outing to a picnic area on the outskirts of town, Joseph hadn’t gone as he’d been invited to Tommy Winslow's birthday party. Since the first day of Kindergarten, Tommy Winslow and Joseph had been best friends. They played together often, visiting each other's houses, and once during a sleep over at Tommy's , they’d  used an old utility razor and cut their palms, swearing an oath to always be friends, and from then on, they’d been blood brothers.  He’d been looking forward to Tommy’s party  for weeks. It was to be a pool party with pizza and even some of the girls from their class were coming. Joseph carefully wrapped the brand new Swiss Army knife he’d saved up for, and he was sure it would be Tommy’s favorite gift. 
 
Dad dropped him at Tommy’s on their way to the ledge.  The ledge was just a nickname for a place families went on short hikes with their golden retrievers and ate cold sandwiches from a cooler.  It was pretty there and his mom loved spending summer days down by the small swimming hole, snapping pics with her Iphone and drinking iced tea. Joseph felt a little guilty for missing a day at  the ledge with his family, but still he chose cake and ice cream over their company.
 
It was such a hot day, Joseph and his friends hardly left the coolness of the pool. They rough housed and played chicken and used super soakers to spray each other in the face.  They ate cold pizza and drank cans of Mt. Dew. He only thought of his family briefly, before cannonballing into the pool for the zillionth time. It was a great day, and Joseph was satisfied that the pocket knife was definitely Tommy's favorite gift.  
 
When the party broke up late in the afternoon, cars pulled up against the curb, while parents picked up their respective offspring who were pleasantly soaked, sunburned and tired. Joseph high fived Tommy and went to sit on the front steps to wait for his dad. After a while, and after a slew of cars came and went, Joseph felt his stomach begin to churn with dread when he realised his dad was over an hour late. Mrs. Winslow stepped outside and told Joseph to come in and wait, otherwise the mosquitos would chew at him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
He sat, wrapped in his towel on their family room couch, as one hour turned into two and two into three. Tommy was playing Xbox next to him, but Joseph couldn’t partake, he couldn’t stop thinking about his parents and Tracy. His hands shook and he felt sick, like he may throw up.  He’d already dialed his mom's phone four times, but it just kept going to voicemail. Tommy’s parents kept assuring him that his family would be there soon, although as the day turned to evening, Joseph thought Mr. and Mrs. Winslow were beginning to look as nervous as he felt. 
 
Just before 8 o’clock, two uniformed police officers were suddenly standing awkwardly in the Winslows living room. Nobody was talking, and Mrs. Winslow had begun to cry quietly. The smaller, less imposing officer knelt in front of the couch and delivered the news that made the hair on Joseph's neck stand on end and he stared in disbelief at the cop.  Mum, Dad and Tracy were never coming to get him. He would never see them again.  Dead. All dead. Car wreck. His parents died instantly but 7 year old Tracy had fought for a few hours before she died on an operating table at the city hospital some forty miles away. Alone. Even his dog Marvin had to be euthanized due to extensive injuries. 
 
Joseph remembered that day, and every detail of it, with perfect clarity. He replayed it over and over again in his mind. He remembered sobbing for hours while the police and some lady from ‘the state’ tried to contact his Aunt Helen.  She was out of town. So the state lady took Joseph to a nearby shelter, handed him a small bag of toiletries and told him to choose a cot and get some sleep.  She promised they’d find Aunt Helen first thing in the morning. Joseph stopped her before she walked away, and asked, his face swollen from crying, where his family was. “They’re dead son” the state lady said, as gently as one could remind a child his life had just taken a devastating turn for the worse. “I know they’re dead”, he had said, “but where are they?”  The state lady (he never did learn her name) shook her head and said they were together, at the morgue. “Where’s the morgue?” Joseph asked, not really sure what that word meant. She was visibly uncomfortable when she told him the morgue is where dead people go, and that it was in the cold and quiet basement of the hospital his baby sister had died in earlier that day.  
 
She left him  in the corner of a gymnasium, on a lumpy bed with itchy blankets and told him to try to sleep.  He did sleep a little.  His body was exhausted, and the sadness in his chest weighed on him like a boulder.  He tossed and turned while horrid nightmares took shape in his dreams. He’d seen all three of them, and even stupid old Marvin, dead on slabs in whereever the morgue was. In his dream, their eyes were wide open, and flies were collecting around his mothers caved in head. He woke up screaming, but his terror fell on deaf ears. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aunt Helen showed up late the next day. She took him to her condo.  He ate canned soup and slept on her couch watching old television shows.  She spent the next few days on her phone, speaking  in hushed whispers, and leaving the room if she thought he was listening.  There was a funeral. Three flower laden coffins lined up at the front of a big stone church.  Joseph hated the suit Aunt Helen had bought him.  Tommy and Mrs Winslow sat close by and every once in a while, he’d feel Mrs Winslow's hand rubbing his back.  Joseph wished with all of his might that the doors of the caskets would open and his family would climb out and rush to where he sat. He wished all of this was just another of the frequent nightmares he’d been having. He wanted his own mom to rub his back and tell him everything was gonna be okay.
 
 He sat through the service staring at the stained glass windows of the chapel, sneaking a few glimpses at the elaborate flower arrangements that filled the front vestibule of St. Vincents.  Once he’d learned what a mercy meal was, he asked if they could hold this tradition at the ledge. Nervous and fidgety, Aunt Helen thought it was a very nice idea.  After they lowered the 3 ornate boxes into the ground at the cemetery, Joseph and a few familiar faces convened at his mothers favorite place by the swimming hole. They ate cold chicken and pasta salads. He stood on the waters edge, knowing he would never come back to this place.   
 
He moved into the spare room at Aunt Helens, and for two years he kept to himself, avoiding her, while she avoided him.  He spent hours walking back and forth  to the house.  He’d stare at it, wanting  to go inside, but couldn’t bring himself to do so.  Sometimes he threw rocks at it. Once he kicked in two of the basement windows. Since the crash, he’d become an entirely different kid. He rarely bathed and he had dark circles under his eyes. He barely spoke and walked with his head down, staring at his feet. He didn’t get invited to any more birthday parties either.  The kids that were once his friends, didn’t bother with him anymore. Not even his blood brother. Tommy Winslow called him a weirdo one day in the cafeteria, loud enough for everyone to hear. Joseph had simply picked up his tray and moved to a far away table. He couldn’t argue, Tommy was right,  he 
 weird. He was 
 weird kid now. He spent most of the next two years alone in his room, eating microwaved dinners and ignoring his homework and instead, reading comics. Still, with each passing day, he became more obsessed with the house Garfield Street. 
 
His graphic nightmares were constant now and getting progressively worse. Images of his decomposing family beckoned him. Telling him to come home already. He’d wake up, sweaty and shivering at the same time. Sometimes it would be hours before he drifted back to sleep, if at all.  He was 12 years old, but because he was so tired and frightened all the time, he had become pale and thin and looked like one of those sick kids in a St. Judes commercial. 
 
Joseph would try to speak with his dead parents while he dreamed but it was as if they couldn’t or wouldn’t hear him. His sister, Tracy, destined to be forever seven years old, would sometimes answer his questions, but she was so young a lot of what she said was nonsensical. She would walk with him while he slept, to the house and if he turned his back, she’d be gone. There was no joy in these nightly visits, just fear and guilt and sadness. 
 
On Tommy Winslow's 12th birthday,  2 years had passed since Joseph's family went to the morgue. 
A bunch of kids were celebrating Tommy’s birthday playing miniature golf and later, seeing a pg13 movie at the mall.  Joseph, of course, was not invited. He pretended he didn’t care, and mostly he didn’t. He had made other plans for that particular day anyway. A way to make the bad dreams stop forever. 
 
 
He stole the gasoline.  He knew the back sliding door would be unlocked. He quietly strolled through the house,  spilling the gas here and there, in places he thought would burn quickly.  He covered the coffee table, and the photo albums, tossing them onto the sofa. He went to each room, crouching and creeping while dumping the accelerant around as he moved. When the five gallon can was empty, he chucked it down the basement stairs. He took one last look around, and sighed deeply. He lit a match and dropped it unceremoniously onto an armchair.  It caught immediately, surprising Joseph. The heat became intense much faster than he anticipated. He turned, ran for the glass door, and leapt into the fresh air of the back yard. He walked around the house a couple of times, making sure the fire he’d lit was doing its job and destroying the damned house. 
 
When he was satisfied the place would burn to the ground, he left. He walked back the way he’d come, on the tracks following the route he’d used regularly for the last two years.  This day, while Joseph walked, there was an unfamiliar  bounce in his step that hadn’t been there since the bad thing happened. He sat for a few minutes on the rails of the tracks.  He screwed his eyes tightly closed and waited for the appearance of his dead repulsive family. They always came when he closed his eyes.  This time, for the first time since the bad thing happened so long ago,
his parents and sister (and Marvin) arrived in his mind's eye, and instead of sadness and fright, he felt content. They were tan and happy, smiling at him, waving at him. Joseph could have sat on those tracks all day, with his eyes closed, flush with visions of mum, dad and Tracy, who’s presence in his dreams had at last become joyous.  Burning down the house had done what two years of therapy hadn’t. 
 
He stood, tried to brush some of the dirt off, and on the railroad tracks he made his way back to Aunt Helen’s condo.  He didn’t get far before the cops stopped him. He remained silent while they bombarded him with questions before putting him in the back of a cruiser and delivering him to Detective Marks.  
 
He liked Detective Marks, Joseph could tell he was what his dad had always called a “no bullshit kind of guy”.  This was even more apparent when the detective locked eyes with him and asked him point blank “What the fuck were you thinking kid?” Joseph blurted out his truth, “They wouldn’t go away, they kept coming back”, he answered, his voice shaking. Marks looked at the pathetic child in front of him, and oddly, he believed the kid. “Joseph,” he said, grabbing onto the kid's hand and holding it loosely, hoping to comfort him when he said the words Joseph knew would be coming. 
 
“All of the Winslows are dead, Tommy, his parents, his brother, hell even the dog” the detective said gently.
 
“I know” was Joseph's only reply. He sat, slumped in his chair, chewing at his fingernails. 
After more questions from the kind detective, Joseph  leaned back, and closed his eyes. He was soon fast asleep in the interrogation room. 
 
At first, he dreamed about the Winslows and Tommy, but only for a minute. They disappeared and in his dream, in his mind, while he slept deeply, he saw himself sitting on a blanket  with his mother who smelled of sunscreen, and he smiled in his sleep as he felt the sun warm on his face. He could hear his father splashing nearby with Tracy. While he slumbered, his smile widened. Marvin was there too, nosing around for scraps, panting in Joseph's ear.

 ",The Bad Thing
,"Kids, Sad","There once was a seed—a tiny, single seed—that fell from the top of the hill and into the cracks of the earth, finding its new home within a dark, lonely cave. The only light to reach the depths was from the small opening where the seed made its fall.
It was a small fit for the seed to take root, but all the while, just as cozy as it needed to be. Day by day, the small ray of sun gleamed down on the tiny seed as it grew more and more. At first, there was just the tiniest bit of stem, but out of the blue bloomed the most beautiful Flower.
The gleam of ruby red under the light of the sun, it was a precious sight hidden away from anyone who could ever enjoy it. That didn’t make the Flower any less beautiful, and the Flower was more than okay with that.
The cave eventually welcomed another member into the depths of the darkness. A small egg, swept away by the wind and brought down onto the petals of the Flower. The Flower was surprised. Never before had it seen an egg before. The Flower held up the egg to the sun and covered it during the cold nights.
One day, as the Flower watched the egg that sat upon its petals, the egg started to move ever so slightly. Slowly, the outer shell started to crackle and something pushed through on the inside of the egg. Out from the shell and found its way onto the Flower’s bright petals.
“Hello my sweet thing,” the Flower chimed.
“Are you my mother?” the Caterpillar asked, looking around the dark cave. The light shining down was starting to fade as the sun was beginning to set. Soon the moon would shine down with its cold gaze.
“No, I am not your mother. I am a friend.” The Flower could sense the sadness in the Caterpillar, now more determined to help it out. “I will help you, anything you need and I will try my best.”
“I am very hungry, do you have anything to eat?” the Caterpillar asked, and the Flower had to stop and think. There wasn’t much to eat in the dark cave, and the poor Caterpillar could not eat from the soil like the Flower did.
“I have many leaves and petals that have fallen off, please eat them.” So that’s what the Caterpillar did, and the Flower made sure to drop as many petals as possible. The poor Caterpillar could not leave the cave for food, so the Flower watched day by day as the Caterpillar got bigger from its petals. As the Caterpillar grew, it would look up into the slightest bit of sky that shined down, watching with fascination as the sun and moon went around.
“Have you ever been out there?” The Caterpillar asked as they watched the moonlight.
“No, I have been in here my entire life.” The Flower responded, enjoying the feeling of the moonlight of its petals before it eventually had to leave.
“I want to go out there and see everything there is. I want to watch the sun and moon the entire day, not just through a crack.” The Caterpillar curled up into the Flower’s petals as the moonlight fled away and left the two encased in the darkness. “Do you want to go out there and see the world? I bet it’s more beautiful than anything else in this cave.”
“I do not wish to leave, for this is my home and I am always happy here. I do hope that you leave one day and see the world so that you can find your happiness.” The Flower rocked its petals back and forth ever so slightly to sway the Caterpillar to sleep. The Flower liked having the Caterpillar here but knew that it was not the Caterpillar’s destiny.
The next day, the Flower could tell that something was about to change. The Caterpillar crawled down the Flower’s stem and hung from a leaf. It was a silent couple of days as the Caterpillar stayed in its cocoon, but there was just a beauty to the silence.
Birds chirps, winds blew, a calming wave of constant tranquility.
Just Silence.
It was such a sweet thing.
The Flower never felt lonely being alone but still appreciated the Caterpillar and eagerly awaited its return. A slight crackling came from the cocoon many days later, and much like the day the Caterpillar crawled from its egg, the cocoon broke apart, and out came a newborn creature. Shiny red wings under the gleam of the sun, a beauty much like the Flower. The Butterfly was excited to show off the wings that carried it above the air.
 “Oh, just look at how they flutter! Do you like them?” The Butterfly gleamed, flying around the Flower.
“They are most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Now you can carry yourself around the world and see all there is to see.” The Butterfly came to rest upon the petals of the Flower, curling up close to the center.
“Won’t you come with me? We could see all of the beautiful things together. I can't imagine not sharing all of it with you.”
“I’m sorry, but this cave is my home and I wish to stay. I hope the best for you, you must go out there and live while the sun still shines bright. When the moon comes out and shines on you, remember the time we spent together.” Sadly, the Butterfly said goodbye, and the Flower responded with happiness before the Butterfly’s wings carried it out of the cave and out of sight.
Day by day, the Flower enjoyed the silence as it watched the sun and moon come by. The Butterfly never came back, but the Flower never expected it to. Each path was different, and while they shared the beginning, their ends will twist different ways.
Soon the warmth from the sun became less and less. The light would shine less, and the nights became longer. When the first snowflakes started to fall, the Flower hoped that the Butterfly had seen all the beauty they craved before the winter came.
Faster and faster, the Flower could feel its leaves become weaker, the color of the Flower’s beautiful petals losing its shine under the sunlight. Winter was coming, and the Flower was coming to the end of its path.
But it was alright. The Flower had known all along. Watching the last petal fell under the weight of the cold snow, the Flower remembered the warmth of the Butterfly. All of the happiness the two shared within the depth of the cave, a bond of two and only two.
They were meant to be but not meant to last.",The Life of a Lone Flower
,"Kids, Coming of Age, Fiction","Megan awoke to the acrid smell of smoke. it hurt her throat and she couldn't stop coughing. She jumped from her bed and ran to her bedroom door. She felt the door like she'd been taught. IF THE DOOR IS HOT, DO NOT OPEN IT. The door was so hot she could hardly touch it. She looked out her second story window and there were reddish orange flames as far as she could see. She was trapped! There was no way out!!!Then the screaming began. ""Someone help me, Mom wake up! Then her screams were interrupted by uncontrollable coughing. Is this how her life would end. She was only ten.
Suddenly her mother was standing beside her.
""Megan it's ok. It's just a dream."" Megan's uncontrollable coughing continued. It was the same nightmare. She began to cry softly. 
""It's so real,"" Megan sobbed. My throat even hurts.
Megan and her mother climbed into the bed. Her mother held her close. She rubbed her back and kept saying over and over, ""I know, I know."" And she did know. The nightmare started the day after her husband and Megan's father died in a burning building. He was a firefighter and had gone into the house to rescue a little girl. He never came out. Megan and her mother had made progress but they were both so sad. It had been almost a year.
They had moved cross country to a cozy little house across the street from the beach. They had new friends, Megan had a new school, and they were trying so hard. But the nightmare's continued and made them both cry.
Megan went into her bathroom to wash her face. She looked in the mirror. She had long blonde hair, just like her mom; and blue eyes just like her dad. Everyone always said, Megan was the perfect combination of her parents. She wondered if the nightmares would ever go away.
As she went back to her room she couldn't help but smile. She LOVED her room. Her mom had let her decorate it the way she wanted. The only rule was she had to keep it clean. Her walls were covered with her watercolor seascapes and sea creatures. She had two large bookshelves one full of books. She loved reading almost as much as the beach. The other bookshelf was called her treasure trove. Each shelf had labeled plastic boxes. The boxes contained treasures she had found on the beach. Each day after school Megan would take a long walk on the beach with her bucket. It was her favorite part of the day. She found natural things like driftwood, sea glass, feathers, and shells. She also found things people had left behind like sunglasses, keys, combs, hair ribbons and even fake fingernails. She cleaned each item and sorted it into one of her plastic boxes.
Megan pulled out the box marked SUNGLASSES, and put in the pair she had found yesterday. There were six pairs in the box already. As she looked at them she imagined a face and a story to go with each pair. Someday she might write a book about them. 
There was also a tall clear glass vase about one third full of sea glass. She loved to dump the glass out onto her bed and feel the smooth cool shapes with her fingers. Megan yawned and remembered she had school tomorrow. Maybe she should try and get some sleep. As she pulled up the covers the still unanswered question floated through her brain. Why would her father run into a house to save someone else's little girl, and leave his daughter with no father? ""Good Night, Dad,"" She whispered. She began to breathe deeply and slowly and drifted off to sleep.
She heard mom in the kitchen and looked at the clock. It was late.
""Mom, why didn't you wake me up?"" Megan yelled down the stairs.
"" I figured you need a few extra minutes of sleep. You have plenty of time, I can drive you to school.""
Megan stretched and began her school morning routine. Being in a routine seemed to help ease the pain. If she did the same thing everyday the same way she could do it without thinking. She looked out the window and everything was blanketed in thick fog. She put on her warmest clothes and clambered down the stairs for breakfast.
""Good Morning, Megan, Now don't forget.""
""Mom, you can trust me, I promise! I won't go down to the beach until you get home.""
""Why don't you invite Sharon for dinner tonight? I'm sure she'd love to see how you fixed up your room. ""
""I don't want to . I have my friends at school, but the beach and my room are just for me.""
Megan's mother looked sad and Megan knew she had to be careful. Her mom was always on the verge of tears. 
""I think I'll take the bus. I have enough time. Megan kissed her mom, and trudged off to the bus stop. Megan loved fifth grade and before she knew it the day was over. The ride home was quiet, Megan wondered what mom had left for snack.
She jumped off at her stop and skipped home. The house seemed quiet without mom, but not scary. Megan changed into her play clothes and headed for the kitchen. Chocolate chip brownies, her favorite. She poured herself some milk and chowed down. Now what? Boring Boring.
Mom's words echoed in her head, ""Don't go down on the beach until I get home."" She knew her mom was just being safe, but she was nine!
Megan went out to the porch. The fog had lifted a bit, and she could see something white being rolled back and forth by the waves. Just my luck, she thought, a fantastic treasure and I can't go on the beach. 
She ran inside and got the binoculars. She focused on the white object. She strained to see it clearly. 
""Oh no, she whispered, it's a seagull."" He must be dead. The body was being tossed again and again in the waves. Just then she saw one wing flutter. Her heart started to pound. She couldn't let him die. But she remembered her mother's words. She ran inside and called Mrs. Jackson, their nearest neighbor. 
""Mrs. Jackson this is Megan. There's a wounded seagull down on the beach and I can't go down to help him because my mother isn't here. She took a deep breath and continued. Can you come up here 
so I can go down and help that poor bird please?
""Megan you know how much I love animals, but I'm giving my baby his bath. I can be there in about thirty minutes.""
""I'm afraid that will be too late. Do you know the phone number for the animal rescue people?""
""Oh, honey, they just come out for larger animals, not seagulls.""
Megan hung up and raced out to the porch, and watched through the binoculars. Megan's jaw jutted out in what mom called her stubborn look. 
I know I'll be punished, but this is a life and death situation.That bird has to be rescued. She got a small cardboard box out of the garage and put an old guest towel in it, and headed down to the water.
When she got closer she could see why the bird was struggling. He was all tangled up in fishing line. One foot and one wing were completely useless. and his eyes were filled with terror.
""Hi, sweet baby, looks like you're in a real mess."" crooned Megan.
She bent down and tried to pick up the bird. 
""Ouch, Don't bite me I'm trying to help you."" She knew the gull was 
panicked and he didn't understand she was trying to help, but his bites really hurt. She tried over and over, but he kept fighting her.
He was getting weaker.
How could she pick him up without getting hurt? Megan gently pushed the bird farther up on the beach using the box, so he wouldn't get washed out by the tide. She ran back to the house, her mom wasn't home yet. She got her mother's oven mitts and raced back to the gull. 
The bird could no longer move his wing and his eyes were closed. Megan put on the mitts and gently picked him up and put him in the box. He continued to peck at her weak as he was. 
""You're going to be fine, I'm going to take care of you. ""Megan walked back to the house with her precious cargo. She put the box and looked more carefully. The fishing line was wrapped too tightly to untangle it. The fishing line would have to be cut. Megan ran up to her mother's room. She wasn't supposed to get into her mother's
things, but this wasn't a day for following the rules. She got mom's manicure scissors and raced back to the porch. The curved blades were perfect for snipping the fishing line, but the ends were too sharp. She was afraid she'd cut the bird. THINK MEGAN THINK! then she remembered something in her Metal Things box. She ran up the stairs and got some nail clippers. ""I think these will work.""
Back on the porch she started chipping the line one piece at the time. It was going to take quite a while to get this done. The bird didn't look good. She went into the house and got an eyedropper and some water and bread. Megan filled the eyedropper with water 
and gently put a few drops of water in his mouth. He swallowed greedily, then opened his mouth for more. She broke off a piece of bread and he liked that too. Just then the door opened. 
""What in the world is going on here?""
""Mom, we don't have time to talk. You can punish me later, but please help me with this bird.""
Megan's mom stooped down and began talking quietly to the sea gull, ""Poor baby, What happened to you?""
""Its those dang fishermen who leave broken lines on the beach this is what happens. 
""Megan it looks to me that you have things under control. Do you want me to hold him so he doesn't wiggle?""
""Yes please, but you need to put on the oven mitts"" Megan continued to cut the strings one at a time. And after about twenty minutes he was free. The gull lay on the porch panting, then got feebly to his feet and began to walk around limping on his left foot. He kept shaking his head. Ate a few more pieces of bread then climbed into the box and snuggled down.
Megan and her mother both laughed. Mom put her arm around Megan's shoulder.
""We need to talk,"" said mom.
""I know, I know, I disobeyed you, but I couldn't let him die.""
""I agree. When I saw you with that bird, I realized how much you're like your father. Now that I no longer have your father, I've been smothering you and I'm sorry."" Megan's mom reached out and touched her face. You are so grown up and responsible and I have to learn to let you be the person you are to become. You figured out exactly what that bird needed and you did it all by yourself. I'm so proud of you.""
Megan started, ""I can't explain what it was like. Mrs. Jackson couldn't come, and the bird was dying and I was the only one to help him."" Then the sobbing began. 
""What is it, sweetie? I'm not mad I'm not going to punish you.""
""I just realized why Dad had to rescue someone else's child. He was the only one who could do it. ""
Now Mother with tears running down her face and said, ""Sometimes we learn lessons in the strangest ways. This seagull taught us both something important today.""

,"Fiction, Inspirational, Kids","I never imagined this would happen I thought as I witnessed the smoke, ash, and worst of all the sinful flame. I watched it destroy our wooden house flame by flame crackle by crackle minute by minute and there was nothing I could do about it. “What are we going to do?” My brother asked in a somber tone, his face was half covered in tears. “Simple we’ll live with our relatives.” I replied. “Listen Jake the only relatives we had were grandpa and grandma. “That’s genius we can stay with our grandparents!” I exclaimed. Winston frowned with a disappointed look on his face. “Jake, grandma and grandpa are long gone, and we’ve already lost our parents in this fire. All our other family members are all the way in Scotland for crying out loud!” “Ok, ok calm down, it’s not the end of the world.” I muttered. “Not the end of the world! Look around Jake, we’ve lost our parents we have nowhere to stay and now we have to get real jobs just to feed ourselves.” “let’s just focus on what’s most important finding shelter.” I said.
“I suppose we’ll have to build the shelter, won’t we?” Winston assumed. I nodded. “How are we going to build a shelter if we don’t have any materials!” Winston exclaimed. “Maybe we can, uhh” I scanned the area “use these leftover pieces of wood from the house.” We both agreed to my idea and got to work.  2 Hours Later…. Yes, we did it! I rejoiced. “Eh, it’s alright.” Winston mumbled. Are you kidding? “This is the best shelter I’ve ever seen.” “That’s because it’s the only shelter you’ve ever seen.” No matter what Winston said I was still proud of us. Time went by I gathered all the important stuff I found from the remains of the fire. Which included: a $10, clothes, hats, a deck of cards and candy. Winston told me that the deck of cards and candy was useless. But you never know, right? Winston being 16 and me only 12 years old we were eligible to work. So, Winston dragged me down to the bookstore so that we could help them print stuff and get money for doing so. But I thought otherwise, you see begged Winston to not force me to do something as boring and uninteresting as that.
He was uncertain at first but eventually agreed. A quiet chime welcomed us as we entered the store. There was an elderly, but friendly looking man waiting at the counter. “What may I do for you boys?” “Winston, pleased to meet you sir. I’d like to work here if you don’t mind.” “Certainly, my boy!” Winston grinned and shook his hand out. The two went on and on about how Winston got the job and how to work the printing press. Me on the other hand took a seat and whipped out my stack of cards. I laid each one in an orderly manner and placed two in my hand. Pictures flashed through my brain I remembered dad sitting down with me when I was 5, he showed me all these wacky tricks and movements with the deck of cards. I snapped back into reality, I caught myself mimicking the same movement my dad once did with the two cards. Here’s how it looked like 1 card was faced to me and the other card was faced to the audience, it almost appeared that the cards didn’t have a backside. I practiced similar tricks like this for a whole hour. Until Mr. Smith (Winston’s new boss) noticed me and my tricks. “That’s some mighty fine tricks you got their son, I bet you’d be able to perform in those big theaters.” Mr. Smith admired.
“You really think so?” I questioned. “Off course!” He exclaimed. That night before I went to bed, I thought about what Mr. Smith said, and then it hit me maybe I could be famous and preform in big theaters. The Next morning: “Winston you won’t believe what I just did!” I said as I rushed into Mr. Smith’s store. His face was covered in ink, and his hair was ruffled. “What happened to you?” I questioned. “The printer exploded.” He replied. “So, what’s up with you?” He asked. “Well, I talked to the guy who owned the theater and he let me preform a magic trick for 30 minutes.” I said proudly. “You think you have enough tricks to fill in the time?” Winston worried. Don’t worry I just need you to show up at 6pm, alight? I instructed. “I’ll be there.” Winston reassured. I checked my watch It was already 6 and Winston was still not here jet. I paced myself waiting, waiting until he’d come… the place was packed not a single seat left untouched. I started the performance with a simple welcome- a bow followed by a “Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the best magic show hosted by yours truly Jake Green.” The first trick was a simple one I’d show the audience 1 card then after I shook it 2 cards appeared. The next trick was making a penny disappear. In between this trick I heard muffled argument after a brief pause the theater’s gigantic doors opened and out swung Winston wearing the biggest grin I’ve ever seen. The 3
 trick really got people going I make a rabbit appear out of thin air. My last trick was like a cherry on top to the whole show, I made a lady float! After I had finished, I had gotten a round of applause people whistled and clapped and Winston was speechless, his jaw nearly dropped. Roses were thrown onstage. I bowed several times. It was a perfect moment everyone was smiling and had a great time. The next morning I was thrilled to see it in the paper the very next day.
I guess that morning was full of surprises because Mr. Smith announced that he was going to adopt us! We were overjoyed by hearing this news. I continued preforming magic tricks all over the world with Winston and Mr. Smith by my side.

 ",A Magician's Dream
,"Christmas, Funny, Kids","Two chubby Father Christmases sat in the bath together, one at the tap end, one at the plug end. It was a rather big bath. The steam from the bathtub swirled upwards and misted the large mirror on one wall, making the whole atmosphere moist and foggy. The Santas were chest deep in foam, their long beards had soapsuds on the ends. They were contentedly splashing each other with their flannels and toy boats. One popped loudly, sending a volley of bubbles up to the surface. They both laughed, until the smell hit them.
‘Phoar’ said one. ‘That stinks.’
‘Sorry’ said the other. ‘Couldn’t help it’
‘Right. I’m getting out’ and then he yelled loudly ‘Mother Christmas!’ Usually, this would bring his wife, scurrying into the room, laden with large, white, fluffy towels to wrap the two St Nicholases up in, and then she would help them to dry themselves. They continued to sit in the tub, casually flicking water at each other, listening for her rapid, footsteps – nothing.
‘Mummy Christmas. We’re ready to get out!’ shouted the other Father Christmas. They both sat still, in the now rapidly cooling water, waiting to hear Mother Christmas’ approach. Still nothing, until finally one said.
‘Brrr, I’ll have to get out, and get the towels.’ He pushed his hands onto the side of the bath, heaving his tubby, body to standing. The warm water had made his skin pink, and bubbles and water dripped liberally off him, as he stepped out onto the floor. He plopped from the room, across the landing to the cupboard where the towels were kept, leaving a trail of wet footprints on the carpet. Speedily, wrapping a bath sheet around his vast waist, he carried another into the bathroom and handed it to the other Father Christmas. They proceeded to rub themselves dry, and then liberally throw baby powder over their semi-damp bodies. The ensuing mess left the bathroom looking like the snow-covered landscape outside their home. They disappeared into their own rooms to get dressed, now leaving two sets of footprints in the scattered talc.
           A few minutes later, dressed in matching tartan slippers, baggy red trousers and plaid shirts, they met on the landing.
‘Time for breakfast’ said one eagerly rubbing his hands together. They descended the staircase into the empty, brightly lit kitchen. Most days, Mother Christmas would be there waiting for them, asking ‘What’ll it be this morning boys? Pancakes, bacon and eggs?’, but today she was nowhere to be seen. In fact, the cottage was eerily quiet.
Whilst the Father Christmases took their bath, Mother Christmas had gone out into their snowy garden. Recently, Santa’s elves had built a massive trampoline out there, and whenever she got the opportunity, she liked to go on it. This morning, was no different, she had crunched across the frost hardened snow, the crisp, cold air pinching her cheeks, plumes of vapour escaping her mouth as she breathed. Quickly, she swept last night’s new snowfall off the trampoline’s black, shiny surface, and with an ungainly flop, manoeuvred herself up on to it. She started to jump, bouncing up towards the inky blue sky. Because this was the North Pole, in the winter the sky stayed dark even during day time hours. As she bounced, her long skirt billowed outwards, revealing thick stripey stockings, and long cotton bloomers, to anyone who cared to look. She only intended to be out for five minutes; she would be back before the Father Christmases needed their towels. Higher and higher she sprung, high above the cottage’s roof, reaching for the bright diamond stars. She leapt higher than she had ever done before, until suddenly, CRASH! Her head hit a solid object, and she was seeing stars of a different kind. She felt herself being pulled, her arms grasped by bony fingers, until she was safely laying on a stable surface. She waited until the whirling in her head stopped, and then opened her eyes. A man was crouching over her, he wore a black top hat, and had a long curling moustache perched under his pointed nose. His black beady eyes met hers, as he asked.
‘Are you alright? You took quite a wallop.’
‘Yes, I think so. I’m so sorry, I didn’t notice you there.’
‘No, you wouldn’t. I’m driving the Rocket Mark Two, fastest sleigh ever built.’ As Mother Christmas came to her senses, sat up and looked around her, she realised that she was sitting on the floor of a sledge. The stranger held out his hand and shook hers.
‘Lucifer Slugchewer. Used sleigh dealer to the rich and discerning. Pleased to make your acquaintance Mother Christmas.’ Before, she had time to wonder how he knew her name, he took her arm and solicitously helped her up onto the sledge’s purple, velvet covered bench seat. It was a luxurious vehicle, the outside frame was silver and glittering, and it was pulled by six, large blue bottle flies. Their wings rapidly flapped, and their iridescent blue and green bodies shone as the sleigh sped through the sky. Mother Christmas realised that the sled was racing through the sky, even as she came to her senses enough to look around her.
‘I’ve been wanting to talk to you for some time.’ Lucifer continued, but before he could elaborate, the sledge began a violent juddering. It stopped as suddenly as it had begun, and Slugchewer muttered. ‘Gremlins in the system. Better continue this when we’re back in my office.’ At this, Mother Christmas noticed three pairs of reptilian eyes peering out from beneath the opposite seat. As she looked more closely, she could see that they belonged to gremlins, their large, fleshy ears and mouths filled with small, pointy teeth made them unmistakable. She began to feel uneasy.
‘Actually, Mr Slugchewer, it’s kind of you to have picked me up, but I’m feeling fine now. If you wouldn’t mind just dropping me back at my cottage, please.’
‘No, no. I beg of you. Just a few minutes of your time at my showroom. I have an offer you’ll find hard to refuse.’ Mother Christmas just wanted to go home, but felt it would be rude to refuse her rescuer a little of her time. In any case, as they spoke the sledge was rapidly descending from the sky and it had stopped outside a large building, which appeared to be constructed entirely of glass. Lucifer leapt from the sleigh and gallantly offered his hand to help Mrs Christmas down from the sleigh. He led her to a door in the glass, and threw it open. There she saw a vast display of sledges and sleighs. There were all shapes and sizes, and at first glance they appeared pristine. However, close inspection showed that most had scuffs on their gilt trims or dents in their shiny paintwork. Slugchewer led her to a desk in the corner, on top there was a computer screen and on either side chrome and leather upholstered chairs. He pulled one out for her and indicated that she should sit.
‘Something to drink, Mother Christmas? Or may I call you Carol?’
‘No, I’m fine thank you.’ He slithered round to the chair opposite and sat down, carefully hoisting his suit trousers up over his knees.
‘The fact of the matter is, Carol, that the bottom has fallen out of the used sleigh business. All sorts of reasons: less witches and fairy queens around. Global warming melting the snow.’ At this Lucifer let out a wistful sigh. ‘So, I’m looking for a new venture, and I think that you can help me.’ Mother Christmas continued to sit stiffly upright on her chair, not saying a word.
‘You see you have access to the lists of presents, which children want. If we could visit the children’s parents before Christmas, tell them what toys their little cherubs want, ask them to give us the money and we’ll buy the gifts for Santa to deliver.’
‘We don’t need money. The elves make the toys.’
‘Exactly, but the parents don’t know that. We can give the elves a cut, to keep quiet and of course, you’ll get a generous percentage for supplying the necessary information.’
‘Absolutely not. It’s criminal!’
‘My dear Carol. You have no choice. You’re not leaving here until you agree.’ Mother Christmas was used to dealing with men demanding their own way. She prepared for a stand-off, or in this case a sit-in, she relaxed back into the chair, crossed her arms and said.
‘Fair enough.’ And with that there was a puff of smoke, and amidst glitter and sparkles a fairy appeared, it was Fairy Nuff.
Meanwhile back at the cottage, the two Santas looked for Mother Christmas, they searched every room, calling her name. When it became obvious that, she was not there, they decided to go to ask the elves if they’d seen her. Pulling on their fur lined wellingtons, they trudged through the crunchy snow to the barn where the elves lived and played. The first Father Christmas knocked on the barn’s wooden door, and it was opened by the chief elf, Robin. He was tall for an elf, being at least three feet, and despite years of experience working for Santa, he still looked young, with rosy cheeks and unlined skin.
‘Morning Father Christmases. What brings you here, so bright and early?’ The rest of the elves were seated around an old-fashioned, pot-bellied stove, eating their breakfasts. The unmistakable aroma of porridge hit the Santa’s’ noses, and their bellies grumbled in response.
‘Has anyone seen Mother Christmas this morning?’ One elf answered ‘She was on the trampoline a few minutes ago, I heard the springs squeaking.’
‘She’s not there now, and she’s not in the cottage.’
‘We’ll help you to look for her.’ And as one, the elves pulled on their curly shoes with bells on the toes, and furry waistcoats and all trooped out of their cosy barn. They searched the workshop where they made the toys, the storeroom where they kept the finished presents ready for delivery, the reindeers stable and finally the garden in case Mother Christmas had slipped and fallen. All to no avail.
‘I think the best thing to do is wait for a while, see if she comes back.’ Suggested Robin. The two Father Christmases nodded in agreement. They didn’t have a better idea. They plodded sadly back to their cottage. Without removing their boots (Mother Christmas always had to remind them to do this), they went into the warm kitchen.
‘Best make some breakfast’ said Father Christmas number one. 
‘One egg or two?’ asked Father Christmas number two.
‘Oh at least six.’ And with that the original Santa, turned one of the burners of the gas hob full on, and placed a heavy black frying pan over it. The other Santa, pulled a tray of eggs from the fridge, cracking them on the side of the wooden kitchen table, and tossing their contents into the pan, dropping the shells where ever they landed. Neither had any real idea how to cook, Mummy Christmas had always done this for them. The high gas, and lack of oil in the pan meant that the eggs in the pan were soon a blackened, cremated mess emitting a bitter, acrid smell of burning.
‘Think they may be a bit overdone.’ Muttered one Father Christmas as he grabbed the pan’s metal handle. He howled in pain and dropped the lot onto the floor, he had forgotten to use an oven glove. The newly released flames leapt up and caught the bottom of his beard alight, which smoked and shrivelled, the heat and blaze speedily climbing towards his face. The second Father Christmas reacted quickly and threw a jug of orange juice over his friend’s burning beard. It did the trick, the fire was put out, but not before the kitchen’s sensitive smoke detector began to let out a high-pitched wail. One Santa stood with orange juice dripping down his face, and the blackened, remaining stubs of his once lustrous, white beard, repeatedly blinking trying to clear the citrous juice and smoke from his eyes. The other dragged a kitchen chair to underneath the shrieking smoke detector, clambered on to it, pulled the device open and removed the battery to silence it. At this point, a horde of elves came running in. They had heard the alarm and were rushing to the rescue. Robin reached up and helped Santa number one to descend from the chair, whilst another elf wetted a tea towel and started to clean the second Santa’s face.
Within minutes, the North Pole’s fire brigade arrived. Leading firefighter, Ebony Abara strode confidently in through the open door. She was tall, the buttercup yellow helmet perched on top of her head accentuating the fact. The double row of gold buttons fastening her uniform’s navy jacket confirmed her authority. Over this were red braces holding up yellow, soot- streaked trousers.
‘Everybody clear the building, into the garden.’ She instructed loudly; her voice clearly audible above the noise of the assembled elves. More firefighters followed her in, they were obviously well trained, one immediately turned off the still flaming gas ring, the others disappearing further into the cottage. Ebony half tailed, half ushered the crowd of elves and Father Christmases out and into the rear of the garden.
‘Everybody accounted for? Any casualties?’ She asked, but then she stopped ‘Two Father Christmases?’ The original Santa explained. ‘This time last year, I was very nearly unable to deliver the children’s presents, I was very ill with coronavirus. After that close shave Mother Christmas said we needed a backup plan. She said that since I’d started the Christmas Eve run, the number of deliveries had more than trebled, and my personal appearances at grottos and places had increased. She said I used to be busy for most of December, but now I was out collecting children’s lists for much of November too. We decided to appoint and train another Santa, to work out of the South Pole.’
‘And that’s me.’ Interrupted the other Father Christmas.
‘Hold on a minute, where is Mother Christmas?’ enquired Ebony.
Having searched the house, her team had filed out into the garden, and were now standing listening to the proceedings.
‘Not in the building. We’ve searched and it’s all clear.’ Responded a short thick set firefighter with a broad Scottish accent.
‘That’s just it, we don’t know, she’s disappeared.’ One of the Santas mournfully answered.
‘Walked out and left them, I should think, judging from the state of the house. There’s mud and orange juice all over the kitchen floor, egg shells and white everywhere, and the frying pan has burnt a ring on the table, there’s a scorch mark up one wall. Upstairs the bathroom floor is soaking wet and everything is covered in talcum powder. Wet towels are scattered all over the place.’ The Scots firefighter announced reproachfully. Both Father Christmases looked guilty[SW1] . 
Back at the sleigh showroom, Lucifer Slugmuncher was also looking shamefaced. Fairy Nuff was giving him a proper telling off.
‘Lucifer Slugmuncher, how many times do I have to tell you to stop trying to drag good, honest people into your ridiculous schemes? You’ve tried selling glass slippers to Cinderella’s ugly sisters that didn’t fit. You tried to con Aladdin out of his magic lamp. Fortunately, he saw right through you. Not only are you a criminal, you’re stupid too.’ Lucifer looked down and pulled the end of his moustache nervously.
‘How else can I make a living? The sleighs aren’t selling.’
‘You get off your skinny, backside and work like other people. You wrap presents with Santa’s elves, you mine for gold with the seven dwarves, you can help Geppetto mend shoes, anything except try to involve other people in your ludicrous money-making plans. Do you understand?’
‘Are you going to punish me?’
‘What turn you into a frog or something? It’s no more than you deserve, but I’m worried that I’d offend the frogs. No, just keep out of trouble from now on.’ With an agitated wave of her wand, she disappeared in a flash, and Mother Christmas found herself back in her own garden, surrounded by elves, firefighters and Father Christmases. The original Father Christmas stepped forward and gave her the biggest hug. ‘Thank goodness you’re safely home. Where were you?’
‘Let’s all go in and have a cup of tea, and then I’ll tell you all about it.’ With that everybody crowded back into the cottage’s kitchen, and over steaming mugs of tea and chocolate biscuits Mummy Christmas told her story. From that day on, the two Santas were much more careful about putting their talc on after their baths.  
 [SW1]",Two Father Christmases sitting in the bath
,"Coming of Age, Kids, Fiction","Hey kiddo, what’s the haps?
Ten year old Ken looked at his father, Robert. He blinked back tears and looked out the car window. His mother watched from the doorway as the car idled in the driveway.
“Ken?”
With a constricted voice he said, “I thought you were gone. Maybe I wouldn’t see you again.”
Robert embraced him. “I don’t know what made you think that. I’ll always be your father.” He took Ken by the shoulders. “Things change, Ken. Things always change. But rest easy. I’m your Dad and you’re my son.” Ken smiled shyly. “I have some errands to run. But the day is yours. What do you want to do?”
“I’ll ride shotgun, Dad. Let’s go.”
Robert backed down the driveway and pulled out. He turned onto the highway.
Ken felt he hadn’t seen his father in weeks. His mother insisted it had only been a few short days. 
They passed a donut shop. 
“Can we get a donut? They have really good ones.” 
Robert smiled at his son. “I’ll run one errand first, kid. Then we’ll stop. Okay?”
“Okay.” They rode for a minute. “Hey, Dad? What will turn on you, no matter how good you treat it?”
Robert watched the road. “Hmmm. Give me a hint.”
“You mean the answer?”
Robert nodded. “Sure…”
“No…”
“Okay, I give up.”
“A steering wheel!” Ken burst into hilarious laughter.
Robert chuckled. “You made that up? Good turn of phrase, kiddo.” He winked.
Ken grinned. “Donut shop…”
“Errand first, remember?”
Ken nodded and watched it recede. The smell of fresh donuts filled the air.
Robert cleared his throat. “You know, Ken. What I said, before? It isn’t anyone’s fault. People change. Whatever the agreement… when things change, people adapt.”
Ken nodded. “Are you divorcing Mom?”
Robert took his time. “I don’t know. But don’t worry about it. People get divorced all the time.”
“None of my friend’s parents divorced.”
Robert frowned. “I find that hard to believe. Knowing some of them… makes no sense they were ever together.”
“But what happens?”
“You’ll be fine. We all will. How old are you, nine?”
“Ten.”
“Well, plenty of time for… I hope you never have to….”
“Like what?”
“Well, in business, people have contracts. They promise to deliver goods in exchange for money. If a guy doesn’t deliver, or the other doesn’t pay… ”
“You mean they lie?”
“I’m not talking about something that simple. No one’s calling anyone a liar, Ken. It’s more complicated…” Robert focused on traffic and slowed for a light. “Look, you play baseball…?” Ken nodded. “So there you are. Strategies change. And everyone adjusts for the better of the game, and the team.”
“Charlie promised to make me pitcher, and then he put me in the outfield. He lied.”
“So… What did you do?”
“I didn’t quit, if that’s what you mean. I told him what I thought and played my position.”
A speeding car passed them on the right and cut him off. 
Robert wrenched the wheel and slammed his brakes. Despite the seatbelts, he reached to protect Ken. He pounded on the horn and yelled. Profanities filled the car. Ken covered his ears. 
Horn blaring, the other car sped away.
“You okay?” 
Ken nodded.
Robert’s cell phone rang. He signaled for silence. “Listen and learn…” He sighed and picked up the call. “George! I’m on my way. Some guy tried to run me off the road.” 
Their conversation continued about things Ken didn’t understand. Business stuff. His father alternated between his stern voice, and laughing.
They passed a donut shop, but Ken remained silent. Robert signed off and muttered something.
 “What do you do? For work, I mean.”
“I’m what’s known as a middle-man. I buy equipment from distributors and get them to customers. That was George. A builder.”
“I want to be a dictator.”
“A what?” Robert chuckled.
“You know, the guy in the office who says to the secretary, ‘Mary, take a dictation…’”
He nodded. “Oh, you mean the ‘manager.’ A ‘dictator’ is different.”
He turned onto a bumpy dirt road leading to a construction site. Big machines moved about the skeleton of a big, new building. A dump truck drove by a sign reading ‘Hard Hats Must Be Worn.’ To Ken, it looked like chaos, great for exploring.
Robert parked the car and got out. “Stay put. I’ll only be a minute.” He approached a man wearing a hard hat, and carrying a clipboard. They nodded while pointing at the building. 
Ken didn’t think they were angry, but they gestured a lot. While his father spoke, the man bit a donut. He waved his donut hand at the building. His father pointed to his watch and they shook hands. Ken’s father walked back to the car over the rough terrain.
“Whew! That wasn’t so bad. Lunch time.” Robert started the car.
“Dad!”
“What?”
“I want a donut. You said…”
“It’s time for lunch, kid. You know what your mother...”
Ken stared straight ahead. “The only thing I wanted was a freakin’ donut. You promised, Dad.”
“Ken...”
“We passed a bunch, but you just keep driving. You don’t listen. You promise but go on and do whatever…”
“You’ll see it isn’t so simple when you grow up a bit.” Ken was not mollified. Robert set his jaw. “Okay… Next stop, donut shop.”
Ken pointed, “There’s one.”
Robert hesitated, “I don’t know that one. There’s a better one, up a ways.”
“It’s a donut, Dad…”
Robert wrenched the wheel and pulled into the lot. He sighed and left the engine idling as they sat. Ken began to fidget. ‘
’ 
Robert pulled out his wallet and handed Ken a twenty, paused, and pulled another. 
“You’re right, Ken. I’m sorry I don’t listen sometimes. Get a dozen. Whatever you like.” Ken’s eyes widened. “And get me a large coffee too. Black.” 
Ken clutched the money and opened his door. He turned back to his father. “Come with, Dad. It’ll be more fun.”
Robert smiled at his son and cut the engine. 
They walked into the donut shop. “What’s your favorite, Dad? You like sprinkles? I always thought they’re over-rated.”
“I’m more of a Bismarck man. You know, with the custard?”
“Oh, yeah! And chocolate on top!”
Robert sat at a table. “Go ahead. Get me a Bismarck and a coffee. The rest are yours.” 
Ken studied the display case. He needed to choose carefully. His father watched. They smiled. 
He brought his Dad the Bismarck and coffee and returned to the wide variety. The plain cake and a double chocolate were simple choices. He eyed a Bismarck but held off. An apple turnover beat out the fritter. 
“Do I have to eat them all now?”
Robert laughed. “Do what you want. You don’t ‘have to’ anything.”
Ken ordered the last chocolate with coconut topping. He committed to the Bismarck and a hot chocolate to wash it down. 
The woman rang up the total and Ken paid. He brought the box to the table and gave Robert the change. 
“I commend you on your fine selection, your discernment, and self-restraint, Ken. Sure you don’t want that éclair? I hear it calling.”
Ken declined. He’d decided. “They had only one coconut left. My favorite.” 
They tapped their Styrofoam cups and drank.
“Thanks, Dad. This is great. You want another?”
Robert smiled. He reached for the donut with coconut topping. 
“Dad! No! That’s mine. You don’t listen!” ",Turning the Wheel
,"Bedtime, Funny, Kids","I jerked my right elbow to remove his hand from my left breast. 
 
“Nope. Not tonight,” I told him, pulling my book closer to my nose. A shield to prevent further attacks. 
 
Adam rolled over onto his back with a huff, then gave me that wounded puppy look that, much like an evening on red wine, makes me want to laugh, then cry. Five years married and he wasn’t showing any signs of slowing down. I suppose I should count myself lucky. But then he hadn’t had to go through what I went through today. Unless they had started a ‘bring your kid to work’ day in the kitchen where he worked as chef. 
 
“How comes, Lou? And don’t say a headache because I already served your spaghetti with a pinch of paracetamol in your parmesan.” 
 
I involuntary cackled before telling him it wasn’t right to joke about that sort of thing. I’m always having to watch what I say at the school and it can take me a while to shake off that cloak. Sometimes until the following morning, when I’ll start calling the shower a twat for taking ages to produce any hot water. When that happens, I’ll use the noise of the cascading shower to bleat any more expletives wanting to hop off my tongue. By the time I’ve dried off, they’ve all been swept down the plughole. 
 
Adam continued. “Are you sure it’s something a nice massage couldn’t help with?” 
 
I brushed his hand away, again. “Oh my god, do you ever give up?”
 
“I love it when you call me ‘God’,” he grinned. 
 
I rolled my eyes up, catching sight of a cobweb in the bedroom ceiling. I knew our cleaner had been cutting corners. 
 
“I just had a really weird day at school. Not really in the mood. Sorry.”
 
“Would telling me help?”
 
“I’m probably not supposed to.”
 
His eyebrows rose up closer to his already receding hairline. It ran in his family. He’d probably just shave it all off in a year or two and then he and his brothers will pass as triplets. 
 
I wasn’t all that interested in my book anyway, so sod it. It’d probably get out soon anyway, knowing what our community is like for gossip. 
 
“Ugh, fine. Get comfortable.”
 
“Oh boy, a bedtime story!” He fluffed his pillow as though crashing cymbals while I fumbled around for my bookmark.
 
“So, this kid at school…we’ll call her Ariana-”
 
“How Grande.”
 
“No interruptions, please.”
 
“Yes, ma’am.”
 
“One of the other kids came over to my desk at lunch while I was marking the history homework I was supposed to have done the other night but you’d brought home those leftovers that gave me the shits (thanks again, by the way). We’ll call her Doja.”
 
“How catty.”
 
I pinched my husband’s lips together. “Let me tell you this before I overthink it and change my mind.”
 
The reply was muffled, indicated concession.
 
“Doja came to tell me that Ariana was out in the Wendy house acting kinda funny. I still had about a dozen pieces to mark but I thought what if the kid’s having a fit or something? Doja tends to downplay things. Like when she said Harry, who we’ll call Harry, had bumped his arm falling off the climbing frame when he’d gone and broken his elbow. So she takes me by the hand and starts marching me off. 
 
Well, turns out Ariana had gone and raided the arts and crafts supply cupboard, because clearly we don’t have the funding to give them the lunch hour excitement they obviously crave. She’d – oh god, this is so wrong – she’d gone and made herself ears out of plastic cups she’d tied to her hairband with bits of string and had pinned a white pom-pom to the back of her skirt. She was calling the Wendy house ‘her mansion’.”
 
“What. The. Fu-”
 
“I told you it was weird. Ariana was telling all her pals – she’s got quite the cult following this one, for always being a show off and drama queen – to call her Miss May. At first I thought she meant like “missed me” and that was the name of the latest game she’d invented, but nope. Oh and by the way, her shirt was lying in one corner of this ‘mansion’ and she was pressing her little chest (luckily she had a vest on) on the windows of this playhouse. One of the boys was asking me if I knew if there was bad weather coming because apparently Ariana had kept telling the others to ‘make it rain’.”
 
I jumped as someone appeared to have pulled the pin out of Adam, who was about to give himself a hernia laughing. 
 
“Oh Lou,” he said between hiccups, “this is too good.”
 
“No, it isn’t. It’s very bad.”
 
“I know – for you, maybe – but for me…I…” I waited patiently for the next convulsion of laughter to leave his system. He rubbed his eyes. “Continue,” he said, in a voice trying very hard to acknowledge the gravity of the situation. 
 
“I had to bend down and knock on the door of the house feeling like a cop come to bust up a house party and asked Ariana what was going on. You are going to love this. So, apparently Ariana’s mother was a Miss April. Actually, now I think about it, I think she’s mentioned it before but I thought it was just a weird way of letting her know her mum isn’t married and they’re on first name terms.”
 
I shrugged, while Adam started to vibrate from barely held in chuckling again.
 
“She said, ‘Mummy told me she was a very famous house bunny and one of the favourites and that men used to pay a lot to go to a house to see her with no top on’ and then starts going on about some make up palette she’s trying to save up for…Christ, kids these days, when I was her age the only palette we used was the one we’d pour oil paint on.”
 
“At least she’s demonstrating a good work ethic. Okay, don’t give me that look. The look that would turn a lesser man to stone.”
 
“So I found myself having to explain to Ariana that she should try to raise funds by…oh, I don’t know, literally any other way possible and that what her mother had done was a grown up job only grown-ups could do and, argh, it was so awkward and from now on I’m locking my door when marking bloody homework. Let some other schmuck figure out how to deal with that shit.”
 
“I feel honoured you shared that with me, Lou. And by the way, when is the next parent-teacher evening and can I tag along?”
 
I elbowed him. Then told him only if he promised not to rabbit on.

,"Sad, Inspirational, Kids","“Are we nearly there yet?” I asked my mum. She shook her head. 
“One hundred and twenty three... one hundred and twenty four... one hundred and twenty five...” I listened to my younger brother Adam counting droplets of rain on the window as we drove. I rolled my eyes. He was so annoying. I listened to the tyres screech as we stopped before the traffic lights. Puddles of rain splashed on the car. Dad grunted at the muddy marks. He hated getting his car dirty. The car started moving again. I opened my mouth to ask another question, when I car crossed straight in front of us. Shattered glass flew everywhere, my mothers scream. Dad trying to pull the car to a stop. My brother crying. 
“Mum? What’s happening?” She reached for my hand. She squeezed it. 
“I love you honey.” She spoke to me, barely a whisper. She held onto my hand as the car crashed through the front seat. Dad first. Then mum. She let go. 
“Mum!” I cry, as the car flips.
************************************************************
I gaze above me. Everything is blurry. I see white-hot flames burning our car. I hear crying. I race to the car. I unbelt my brother first, and I yank him out the car. I run to a bench to put him on while I helped my parents. As I place him down, I turn back to the car, when I bursts up in flames. I gape at the car as it gets engulfed in the fire. Mother... and father. I clasp my hand over my mouth. I run to my brother. My face in one hand, I sob, holding my brother in the other arm. Why wasn’t the rain putting out the fire? I race into a store. As I open the door, I choke on the smoke. I realise it is a bookshop. Everyone in the store looks away from the window to look at me and Adam. 
“Well don’t just stand there!” I scream at them, “Call the police!”
They nod, and once they finish working out who is going to call, they press numbers into their phones, and soon, a police car, ambulance and fire engine arrive at the scene. Once they put out the fire, they pull out mum and dad.   
“I’m sorry to say this Elizabeth, but your parents have perished.” I stare at the policeman, then look at Adam who is playing on the staircase with another boy and his dad. Laughing. I understand that he is little, but why is he laughing at such a horrible time like this?
************************************************************
“Why are we in a p’lice car?” Adam asks me, looking at the policeman. 
“Are we in trouble?” I smile and shake my head. I start to silently sob. 
“Are you ok? Was it me? Where are mummy and daddy?” 
“I’m ok. Mummy and daddy are going to be away for quite some time, ok? But don’t worry. I won’t leave you. Not for a second.” I grab my brother into a hug, and silently whisper into his ear. 
“I promise.”
************************************************************
“You’ll have to tell him eventually.” Policeman Joey tells me. I look through the window. I watch Adam playing around in the interrogation room while the policeman gave up asking questions to play with him. The policeman and him are playing tag.
“That’s not my job.” I tell him. “That’s your job. You’re responsibility.”
The Joey sighs, then nods. He knocks on the interrogation room door, and they both stop. The other policeman opens the door, and Joey whispers something to him. The policeman nods and says bye to Adam. Joey tells Adam to sit down for a minute. He listens, and plops into a black chair. Joey lowers his voice and talks to Adam. His smile suddenly disappears. Tears trickle down his face. He looks at me through the window, and I look at my feet. Why did it have to happen like this?
************************************************************
As we are told we have to go now, I grab Adams hand. He looks up at me, eyes red from the tears. I smile sadly at him, and he hugs my legs. I pick him up and hug him. At that moment I realise. We are orphans. Will we go to an orphanage? Or family? What about the house? And what about Billy, our dog? Will he be ok? Questions. “Hey, Joey? Are we going to an orphanage?” Joey gulped. He shook his head. 
“No, you will be staying with your great aunt, Matilda.” 
“Who? Never heard of her. Why aren’t we staying with auntie May? Or grandma and grandad?” Joey nervously scratched his head. “Because they are all incapable of looking after your dog, let alone you! I assure you, her criminal record has expunged and-”
“Wait wait wait... criminal record? I don’t want to live with a felon!” “You won’t have to,” Joey said impatiently, “as I mentioned before, it has expunged. Now would you please stop complaining, and hop into the car. You will pack your bags and immediately go to your great aunts. That or you will both have to go to boarding school, while your aunt May gets an adoption licence. But boarding schools are private, and private schools are one gender only, so you’ll have to go to seperate schools. And I am sure you don’t want to live apart so soon after this terrible accident, do you?” I look at Adam. He looks back up at me. He shakes his head. 
“No.”
************************************************************
When we get to our house, the warm tingly feeling has gone. The only happiness was Billy greeting us at the door. Memories of picnics in the garden, games of tag, planting flowers. I run into the house which Joey unlocked. I go into my room and open the wardrobe door. I pull out my suitcase and throw my clothes in. I’m about to scream when Adam comes in. 
“Lizzy? I can’t find Binky.” I smile at him. 
“Let’s see if we can find him.” I help look in his room. Everything that used to be filled with joy feels so... empty. So empty and grey. I lift his pillows up. There was a little soft bunny in the shape of a square. He was kind of like a handkerchief but also a cute toy.    “Here he is.” I pick him up and hand him to Adam.                          “Thanks... Can you help me pack?” 
“Of course.”
************************************************************
As Adam and I pulled our suitcases behind us, Joey taps his watch. “You’re late.” 
“Oh, so were on a timer now, are we? Our parents just died. Give us a break.” Joey awkwardly smiled, obviously embarrassed. He nodded and lifted our suitcases into the boot. We hopped into the car, and I carried Billy in a dog carry-me-cage. I placed his cage in the middle seat and turned to Adam. 
“You excited?” Adam shook his head.											              “No. Why didn’t mummy or daddy tell us about her?” I pondered about this for a moment then shrugged.
 “I don’t know. But what I do know is, Billy is upset because you are.” “He is? But how?” I smiled at him. 
“He is like a human. He has emotions too.” Adam nodded. 
“Here we are.” Joey said to us, stopping the car.
************************************************************ 
“Come on, Adam. Don’t be shy.” I nudge Adam on the shoulder. Billy barks happily. Adam shakes his head. It starts to rain. 
“Come on. We don’t want another disaster in the rain.” 
He looks out the window, then takes in a big breath.
 “Let’s do this for mummy and daddy. Let’s do this... for us.” He says as he opens the door. He tugs his suitcase out the boot. I do the same. We say goodbye to Joey, then roll our suitcases up the path. “Let’s do this.” We say at the same time. 
“We love you mummy. And you too, daddy.” Says Adam.                  “Of course we do. We love you guys. Let’s knock on the door.”      “But what about the doorbell?” Adam asks.                                    
“Let’s do it the good old fashioned way.” Adam nods.
KNOCK KNOCK.
 
 ",Disaster in the Rain
,"Fantasy, Inspirational, Kids","The sky is gray and rainy.  Rain pelts down, and suddenly, an envelope descends.
Daniel Wilson, 11, carrying a school backpack, counts off on his fingers as he points to the raindrops. 
 
The letter falls onto the sidewalk. Maria, 11, cute, picks up the letter and looks at the writing, then held out the envelope to Daniel.
 
“Take it.  It's got your name on it,” she calls out.
 
Daniel takes the envelope and sees the name ""DANIEL"" on it, but he can't read the rest of the writing though the rain.
 
Maria smiles. “That's you, right? Daniel? Danny?”
 
Daniel waves with the letter and walks into his apartment building, up the stairs, into his apartment. 
 
Lots of computers in various states of being fixed litter the room. Daniel enters and hangs his key on a hook near the door. Daniel's father, Bill Wilson, 33, in jeans, shirt and tie, rolls around in a wheelchair out of the darkness, tinkering with a motherboard. 
 
“The guy sold me an iMac motherboard, would you believe? It's still good. Expand the memory slots and no problem,” Dad said enthusiastically.
 
“Cool,” Daniel replied.
 
“What you got there? Report card?”
 
“Love letter.”
 
Dad laughed. “Little schoolyard smooch doesn't do any harm. That's how I met your ma.”
 
At the mention of her Daniel brightens. “I forgot! We're supposed to Skype.”
 
He runs to the one working machine in the room, an iPad, and turns it on. He clicks on Skype.
 
Dad frowns. “We already Skyped, pal. Sorry.”
 
Daniel stares at ""ANNABEL WILSON"" in the contacts. Her Skype status reads ""Offline"". Her Skype image is of the US Air Force symbol. 
 
Dad says, “She had to fly out. Recon mission.”
 
“But she's coming home for Thanksgiving. Right?”
 
Dad hesitates. “That's the plan, champ. Hey. What do you say we go for tacos after you finish your homework?”
 
Drawings cover the walls of Daniel’s room. The letter dries on a radiator. Daniel sits at the desk and draws. A rainstorm takes shape on the paper, and then several white rectangles.  Daniel draws stamps in the rectangles. 
 
Dad’s voice echoes. “Your grandma always gave me an apple after school.”
 
Dadputs an apple down on Daniel's desk, then leans closer, looking at Daniel's drawing. “This is homework?”
 
“Teacher says we're supposed to tell a story with a picture.”
 
“You do your math first. Okay?”
 
Daniel nods and takes a bite of the apple. “Thanks.”
 
Dad looks as if he wants to say something, but goes out. Daniel gets up and goes to the window. He picks up the dry letter. Reads the name and address. ""Daniel Gomez."" He opens the letter, takes out a photo of a smiling Latina woman and a tiny baby. Daniel reads the writing on the back.
 
""M'ijo, my baby. I have been trying to find you. I am your mother. You see you and me? I am so sorry. I don't know who you are. I only have this address. If you look at my face and find something good, come and find me. I'll explain everything. Vaya con dios, m'ijo.""
 
Daniel turns the photograph this way and that.  He goes to his backpack and unzips it. He takes out a book titled ""Spanish I"" and flips through it. 
 
“M'ijo...mi hiho....hijo. Son. Vaya...con...dios...Go with God.""
 
Daniel goes to the window and looks out in wonder. “I'm God's post office.”
 
He opens his math book and hits the book. He has a tough time, eventually finishing the assignment. All the while he stares at the picture of the woman. 
 
Algebra and numbers dance over the woman's face. As Daniel is working on his math, he draws a doodle of the woman with algebra equations around it: Baby - Mom = x.
 
The door opens, and Bill pokes his head in. “Taco time.”
 
Daniel and Bill share an enormous taco platter in a tiny homey restaurant. 
 
The next day at school in Daniel’s big classroom, a line of students jockey to use the computers. Some kids are playing with iPads. Daniel sits at his desk with the photograph, drawing the mother and baby.  
 
Maria comes over and looks at him. Daniel hides what he's doing. The other girls giggle. Frank, the class bully, shoves Maria out of the way. “Hey...hey...nerd, watcha doing?  You don't like computers?”
 
He grabs the photograph and drawing.  Daniel glares at him.
 
Frank snickers. “Awww...is this Mommy? I heard she left you guys.”
 
Daniel sniffs. “She’s in the Air Force.”
 
Frank makes a move to rip the photograph and drawing. Maria snatches them out of his hand and gives them back to Daniel. Maria shoves the Bully. The Bully, shocked, makes a beeline for the other side of the room. Daniel and Maria exchange smiles.
 
After school, it hasn't stopped raining. The kids rush outside toward the school bus. Daniel runs with them. He walks down the aisle of the school bus. He sees Maria, hesitates, and sits next to her. “Thanks.”
 
“What were you doing?”
 
“Where’s Meadow Brook Acres?”
 
Maria smiles. “First tell me what you were doing.”
 
“Drawing. Where's Meadow Brook?”
 
“Over where I live...but you don't get out there.”
 
Daniel sits quietly.
 
“I'll show you where it is,” Maria offers.
 
“Thanks.”
 
Maria surprises him when she says, “Can you come over?”
 
“Not today. I’ve got something to do.”
 
“Tomorrow. We can have enchiladas. I bet you've never had them.”
 
Daniel grins. “Have too.”
 
“Not like my mama's.”
 
Twenty minutes later they stand outside a small brick house. Daniel and Maria look at it.
“Who lives here?” Maria asks.
 
Daniel shrugs.
 
“You'll tell me tomorrow.” Maria kisses him before he can react and walks away.  Daniel rings the bell. He waits patiently. No one answers. He sits and waits.
 
A voice wakes Daniel with a start. “Hey, kid.”
 
Daniel wakes up to see Danny Gomez, Latino, mid-40s, wearing a raincoat with a hood.
 
“Daniel Gomez?”
 
Danny Gomez takes off his hood. “Yes? How do you know my name?”
 
“I’m Daniel too.” Daniel unzips his backpack, takes out the envelope, and hands the envelope to Danny Gomez. “I'm God's post office.”
 
Danny Gomez looks at the open envelope, then looks at Daniel. “You shouldn't open other people's mail, especially these days.”
 
He takes the photo out of the envelope and stares at it. He turns it around and freezes as he reads the back of it.
 
Daniel rummages around in his backpack and takes out the picture he drew from the photo. He hands it to Danny Gomez. “This is for you.”
 
Danny Gomez studies the photo, the drawing, and the envelope. He looks down at Daniel and waves the drawing. “Come inside. We'll call your parents, let them know you're OK.”
 
The house is full of easels and paintings. Danny Gomez spreads out the photo and drawing on the kitchen table. He studies them both. Daniel stands. Danny Gomez looks up. “Not going to eat you. Take off your raincoat before you catch cold.”
 
Daniel does, and he puts down his backpack. Danny Gomez goes to the stove.  There's a kettle on the stove. Danny Gomez turns on the stove. “Sit down. You like hot chocolate?”
 
“Cool. Please.”
 
Danny Gomez opens a cupboard and gets a tin of cocoa. “How'd you find me?”
 
“School bus.”
 
Danny shook his head. “The school bus doesn't stop here.”
 
“You don't have kids?”
 
Danny Gomez sets two cups down and goes to the kitchen table. “They're with their mom. In Miami. I guess you know my story. If you read what's on that photograph.”
 
Daniel nods.  
 
Danny clears his throat. “I guess we better call your folks.”
 
“They're not home. My mom is in the Air Force.”
 
Danny looks sympathetic. “Where's your dad?”
 
“Fixing people’s computers at home.”
 
“Then he should be home.”
 
“He was meeting people all day,” Daniel says, a little too fast.
 
Danny stared into his eyes. “They don't know you're here, do they?”
 
Daniel doesn't respond. Danny Gomez goes to the table and picks up the photograph.
“Do they know about this?”
 
Daniel stays silent.
 
“What’s your phone number? Don’t all you kids have a cell phone?”
 
“I left mine at home.” Daniel gets his sketch pad out of his backpack and writes his phone number on sketch paper. He rips off the sheet and gives it to Danny Gomez, who quickly dials the number. 
 
“Hello? Mr. Wilson? This is Danny Gomez. Your son's here at my house…” 
 
Daniel hears his father’s raised voice on the other end.
 
“He’s perfectly fine. He took the bus here. He was returning something I lost.”
 
Danny Gomez winces as he listens. “I understand. He’ll stay right here.”
 
He hung up the phone. “Kid, you were lucky. He’s on their way.”
 
Danny Gomez makes the cocoa and brings it to Daniel. “Why'd you bring me that picture?”
 
“I miss my mom too.” Daniel sips the cocoa and grins. “You paint?”
 
“You change the subject a lot. Yeah, I paint.” He studies Daniel's drawing and the photo. “Let's talk about you. How long have you been drawing? You’re good.”
 
“Mom says I should show my work to my teacher so I can get scholarships.”
 
“So do you show them?”
 
Daniel looks into his cocoa. Danny Gomez sighs. “I didn't want to show anyone either. Thought I was no good.  But I was just scared.”
 
Danny Gomez gets up, takes their cups and pours more cocoa. Daniel holds up the photo.
“Are you going to go see her?”
 
Danny Gomez freezes, holding the cocoa cups.
 
“She's really sorry.” Daniel says.
 
Danny Gomez comes to the table. “You think I should?”
 
“Definitely.”
 
Danny thinks about it. “Tell you what. You show your work to your teacher, and I'll go.”
 
Daniel thinks about it. “Okay.”
 
Danny Gomez hands Daniel the cocoa cup and clinks it with his own. Daniel smiles.  
 
After they have cocoa and talk, Danny Gomez shows his paintings to Daniel.
 
“Really cool,” Daniel says.
 
“You do portraits?”
 
“Weather mostly.”
 
Danny is thoughtful. “You do well on portraits.  Ever thought of setting up a table, when it stops raining, and charging people to do their picture?”
 
“Could I do that?”
 
“No one says no to a kid.”
 
Daniel touches the paintings. The doorbell echoes through the house. Danny Gomez looks at Daniel. “I'll be right back.”
 
Danny Gomez exits. Daniel stares at the paintings. He turns all around, looking at them.  
His dad runs in and swoops down on him, grabbing him. “What were you thinking?
You know what could have happened?”
 
“I was hanging out with Danny.”
 
Dad stares at Danny for a long moment. “Thanks.  This won't happen again.”
 
“Actually...I'd like to ask you if I could give Daniel art lessons.”
 
Dad’s mouth drops open. “Why?”
 
“I think he’s talented.”
 
Dad looks around at Danny’s paintings. “Maybe…But we insist on paying you. Let me talk it over with my wife.”
 
Danny gives Dad his phone number, email, and address. “We’ll be in touch.”
 
Danny Gomez shakes Daniel's hand. Dad clumsily shakes Danny Gomez's hand. “Where's Danny's coat and backpack?”
 
Danny runs and gets the coat and backpack. “Hey, Daniel. You keep on painting.”
 
As Dad and Daniel walk outside, Dad pulls him close. “Don’t ever do this again…He was nice, but you have to be careful.”
 
“Can I go to Maria's tomorrow?”
 
Dad shakes his head. “We'll see.”
 
The next afternoon, Danny Gomez stands on the doorstep of a large split-ranch house in a quiet neighborhood. He looks at the envelope, then knocks on the front door. The door opens and Danny’s mother Angelica Rossi, the woman in the photograph, opens the door. She and Danny stare at each other. Danny holds up the photo and Daniel's drawing. Angelica gently touches them.
 
At the same time, at Maria’s house, Maria’s mother Isabel holds Maria's and Daniel's hands. Daniel’s dad waves as he gets into the Ford Pinto. Daniel grins. 
 
Maria sits on her bed as Daniel sketches her.
 
At school the next day, Daniel’s teacher sits at a desk grading papers. The students line up once again to use the computer. Daniel, holding his drawing of Maria, walks up to the Teacher's desk. The teacher looks at Daniel. Daniel lays the drawing on the teacher's desk and grins shyly.  The other kids stare curiously. The teacher holds up the drawing. Daniel offers another one, the one with the envelopes. The teacher smiles at Daniel.  
 
After school, Daniel sits outside in the rain, sketching an elderly couple.  A gust of wind blows an envelope out of the sky. Daniel grabs it and looks at it. He holds out the envelope to the couple. “I think this is for you.”
 
The couple give him money and hugs. Daniel shows them the completed sketch.",Daniel's Letter From Heaven

,"Kids, Funny, Happy","Cecelia Lewiston Brown was named after her mother’s great-grandmother, Cecelia Parker Lewiston, who had been a leader in both the women’s suffrage and prohibition movements. Cecelia’s parents were proud of that heritage and, even though Prohibition ended up creating more problems than it solved, they hoped that some of her namesake’s social activism would rub off on their daughter as she grew up.
 
Four-year-old Cecelia Lewiston Brown carried the burden of her parent’s great expectations lightly. Indeed, if truth be told, her “social activism” had thus far been limited to the time she spent playing with friends at her college-prep preschool and with her special friend, Maria, who lived three houses down on the other side of the street.
 
As with most children her age, Cecelia—or “Sissy” as she was called by her parents—was smarter and more above average than all the other above-average children her age. She wasn’t aware of this, of course, but her parents knew, and reminded Sissy’s grandparents of it as often as possible. The grandparents were also true believers and were already convinced that if life was fair, Sissy would eventually graduate from Harvard Law School and wind up on the United States Supreme Court.
 
Maria, however, didn’t see it this way at all. As far as she was concerned, what Sissy did best was to stomp and splash water when she walked past a puddle.
 
Sissy was good at this for two reasons.
 
The first reason she was so good at splashing in puddles was because she had a new pair of yellow rain boots with a picture of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs on them. Although it didn’t make any sense for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to be on a pair of yellow rain boots, Sissy had not yet reached an age where it mattered whether things made sense or not. The only thing that mattered in her life were the twin postulates: “Everything is possible,” and, “Nothing is impossible.”
 
	The second reason Sissy was so good at splashing in puddles was because she was a giant. No one knew this but Sissy, and it was such a big secret that even Maria didn’t know about it.
As far as Sissy’s mother was concerned, the world was a very big place and her daughter was very small.
 
As far as Sissy was concerned, it was the other way around.
One morning, on an unusually gray November Saturday, Sissy walked up to her mother and said, “I want to walk on the beach.”
It was not a question. It was not a demand. Sissy was simply letting her mother know what she wanted to do at that particular moment. Then again, although it was a simple and straightforward sentence, it carried with it the assumption that her mother would immediately stop whatever she was doing and walk with her to the beach.
 
Sissy’s mother complicated things by saying, “No. Not today.”
 
“Why,” Sissy asked.
 
“Because it’s raining,” came the reply. “In fact, it’s been raining all day and it’s not supposed to stop until tomorrow.”
 
She paused before adding, “Actually, it’s supposed to stop raining early tomorrow morning while you’re still asleep. That means we can go to church without getting wet. Perfect timing, don’t you think?”
 
Sissy wasn’t sure about what her mother had just said.
 
“What does perfect . . . ?” she began.
 
She couldn’t remember the next word her mother had used (which was “timing”) so she started over again.
 
“Wouldn’t it be more perfect if it stopped raining now?”
 
Her mother, who held degrees in Philosophy and Business Administration, started to say that one perfect thing can’t be more perfect than another because the concept of “perfect” was an absolute. Two things could be equally perfect, of course, but nothing could ever be “more perfect” since perfect things are either perfect or they’re not.
 
She wanted to say these things but she didn’t.
 
She wanted to say these things because she spent most of her time with Sissy and didn’t get to have adult conversations except on Sundays when the family went to church and on Mondays when her husband stayed home to watch Sissy so she could do the bookkeeping for the town’s Mexican restaurant and volunteer for three hours at their church’s weekly free dinner program. On most days, her husband was the only adult she talked with.
 
As it turned out, Sissy’s mother’s decision not to explain the abstract absolutism inherent in the word, “perfect,” had nothing to do with Sissy being only four-years old. It was, in fact, a house rule that all adults always spoke in an adult manner, whether Sissy was in the room listening, or they were speaking to her directly.
The reason Sissy’s mother didn’t pursue the subject was because she suddenly had second thoughts about Sissy’s first question and the way she had answered it.
 
 
 She thought to herself. 
 
“Get your boots on,” she said. “It’s always perfect timing to go for a walk.”
 
Sissy slipped her yellow boots on all by herself and her mother helped her with a warm sweater and her blue rain slicker. After putting on her own raincoat and grabbing two umbrellas, she handed one to Sissy and the two of them stepped out the front door and into what had turned from a winter shower to a biblical deluge.
 
, thought Sissy’s mother.
 
 thought Sissy.
 
There were puddles everywhere. Even puddles inside of puddles!
 
As they walked along the now-deserted, dead-end road that led to the edge of the Pacific Ocean, Sissy went straight to work and began to splash up a storm of her own.
 
Since she was a giant, the puddles became lakes and oceans.
“Take that!” she shouted as she stomped from one to another.
Water flew in all directions, even into her boots. which were all squishy and sloshy inside by the time that she and her mother stepped onto the sandy path that wound its way to the beach.
 
There were no puddles on the beach so Sissy pretended she was a giant crossing a vast, dry, empty desert. This meant, of course, that she had to pretend it wasn’t raining.
 
she wondered,
 
Although she had never seen a parasol, she decided to use her umbrella to keep the hot, desert sun from turning her into a piece of toast.
 
Thinking of toast made her think of food, and thinking of food made her think about being hungry.
 
, the decided.
 
“Mommy,” she said. “I want to go home.”
 
“But we just got here,” her mother said with a smile.
 
“I want to go home and I don’t want it to rain, anymore,” Sissy announced.
 
As they walked back along the trail Sissy reached out and held her mother’s hand.
 
 She thought.
 
It took her several steps before she could make sense of it.
 
 she decided.
 
So, hand in hand, the two giants walked down the street towards home, stomping and splashing their way through lakes and oceans, jumping over great rivers and hopping from one island to the next.
 
As it turned out, Sissy’s mother never found out she was a giant. This was because Sissy never told her and kept it a secret, even from Daddy when he came home from work that afternoon.
 
As she walked up the driveway to her house, Sissy stood on her toes, reached towards the sky as high as she could, and twisted her hand to the left. It was the same way she turned off the water in the sink when she washed her hands in the bathroom.
 
And, because she was a giant, the rain stopped immediately.
 
As Sissy skipped into the house, she heard her mother announce that it was time for a snack.
 
And as the door closed, the sun broke through the clouds.",Great Expectations
,Kids,"In the middle of a far away town Amy lived with her family away from the big noisy city. 
One day Amy’s mum was very very sick, she was sleeping in her room for the whole day, her dad went to work and he left his phone at home. Amy was sitting next to her sick mum crying and didn’t know what to do. While she was crying, looking outside the window, watching the rain, she saw something very special in the middle of the garden, it was a beautiful blue rose sparkling in the middle of the front garden.
Amy thought “ this flower wasn’t here few days ago when mum and I were watering the garden.” She was looking to the flower and every rain drops touched it turn into a beautiful crystal ball. Amy was amazed of what she saw and she ran down in the rain to have a look at the blue flower and have a feel of it, as soon as she reached the garden she heard the most calming music she have ever hear in her life coming from this unique flower. She quickly got down and touched it, she felt so powerful straight away. The magical flower said “Amy I know you are feeling sad today because your mum is not feeling well!” Amy was shocked and replied “how did you know that?” The magical flower said with a smile “ I was once a little girl just like you, a bad frog touched me and turned me into an ugly frog like her and I needed a butterfly to turn me back into a flower, the kind butterfly touched me yesterday and turned me into a magical blue flower in your garden. Then she told me I  need to help someone on a Rainy day and make them feel happy in order for me to be beautiful little girl again. She also promised me that she can take me back to my family.” Amy smiled and said “ may be you can help me to make my mum feels better?” The magical blue flowers said “ ok listen to me here is what you are going to do, you need to collect all this crystal balls and put them in a cup of water and let your mum drink from it. After she finish the cup she will feel better.” Amy shouted “ oh really my mum will feel better when she drink from the crystal water?” and quickly start collecting them, she ran up to put them in a cup of water and give it to her mum. The magical blue flower cried “ please don’t forget to come and touch me when your mum gets better!” Amy replied “ I will be back very very soon.”
Amy ran to the kitchen and put all the crystal balls inside a cup of water and gave it to her mum. Her mum started to drink the water slowly as she noticed the water tasted differently, she asked Amy “ why this water tasted so different and better than the water we drink everyday?” Amy replied “ it is  a magical crystal water that the magical blue flower gave me to make you better.” Amy’s mum closed her eyes for a few minutes and when she wakes up she jumped of the bed saying “ oh my God I feel so much better now! I’m not sick anymore.” She asked Amy to tell her about the magical blue flower, Amy told her mum the whole story about the magical blue flower and how she needs to help someone and make them happy in order for her to become a little girl again. Amy and her mum quickly ran down to the garden to look for the magical blue flower and they both heard the beautiful music that the blue flower makes. Amy’s mum said “ little blue flower I came to thank you for making me feel better. Now my daughter and I want to help you to became the beautiful little girl again.” 
the magical blue flower replied with happiness “ “yes please! Can Amy touch me with her right hand ?” Amy said “ yes sure I can” and quickly touched the magical blue flower with her right hand, the blue flower started to turn into a beautiful little girl! Amy and her mum cried “ oh my God you look so beautiful!” The little girl start to tell them her story, “ my name is Rose I used to live with my family in a beautiful house in the big city, one day I lost my way and a bad frog touched me and turned me into an ugly frog like her, I needed a butterfly to touch me to turn me into a flower and then I needed to help someone to become a little girl again.” Amy and her mum were very happy that they both helped Rose to became a little girl again.

,"Bedtime, Fantasy, Kids","  ""OK kids, snuggle up and Gramps will tell you a story. Don't need no books. This story is sitting right here is this old head of mine. It happened to me right back then when I was knee-high to a grasshopper. Never forgotten it and I never will, not until they put me in a box in the churchyard, next to your Grandma.
 
   Well, it started out a normal enough day. I was up and about good and early and there was no hope of breakfast yet, so I opened the back door quietly and went off down the yard to use the outhouse. None of your fancy en- suites in those days or even indoor plumbing. It was just about light enough to see, if I left the door hanging open a crack. Light enough to have a quick check for spiders or snakes before sitting down to do my business.
 
  When I came out there was still no smell of cooking from the kitchen so I took it into my head to go foraging . It was early in the season but I'd spotted some juicy looking berries the day before. It was mushroom season too and I knew how good a plate of eggs and field mushrooms would go down. 
 
   The sun was doing its best to rise, but big grey clouds were gathering faster than the cobwebs collecting in the corners. Your great- grandma never was much of a one for cleaning above eye level. Anyway it looked like rain was on it's way so I thought I'd best get a wriggle on. I set off out the yard and down the lane and my bare feet sent up little puffs of dust from the parched ground.
 
   Pretty soon I came to the bramble patch and stuffed my mouth with berries until the juice ran down my chin. Anyone passing would've thought I was half starved. To tell the truth my stomach was feeling pretty hollow and I kept thinking of the great breakfast I'd be getting if I found those mushrooms.
 
   I climbed the fence into the wood and set off to the shady spot where I knew the mushrooms would be, if only the squirrels hadn't found them first. The sky was getting darker and there was a distant rumble of thunder. A few drops of rain fell but the trees still had most of their autumn leaves and I was sheltered from the worst.
 
  My luck was in. Clustered on the bank were a dozen or so field mushrooms. I pulled them carefully, leaving the roots to carry on growing for another day. That was when I realised I had nothing to carry them in, so I whipped off my shirt and tied them into a bundle, leaving me in just my raggy shorts. The rain was coming down heavier now so I figured to get back home as fast as I could run.
 
   As I left the shelter of the trees I was soaked through in seconds. I scrambled over the fence and that's when I first noticed it. The sky was melting.
 
    You ever done one of those water colour paintings where you get the paper really wet then let the colours run down and spread out? Well that's what seemed to be happening. Where there had been thick grey cloud, a mist of colours appeared across the sky and ran slowly downwards. At the same time they spread sideways so the colours mingled into a curtain of reds, blues and yellows.
The more it rained the more the colours intermingled and now I could see greens, purples and oranges too.
 
   As I stood, I couldn't hardly bear to look around, the sight was so dazzling. Then it dawned on me that the display wasn't stopping with the sky. The colours of the trees started to disolve and the autumn leaves added their fiery hues. The wash darkened as the browns of the trunks and branches changed the palette .The shapes of the trees disappeared as I stared in amazement.
 
  A terrible thought struck me. I turned around. Where our house had stood was just a growing smudge of smoky grey. I looked down to find I was standing in a rapidly deepening puddle of water. It was that ugly shade that you get when you mix every colour in the paint box, with an oily slick of rainbow colours swirling on the top.
 
   Desperately I turned round and round trying to find a solid object in this melting world. There was only me, a tiny, terrifiedl figure, in a fading mass of ever changing colour. I wondered if I was going to wash clean away along with the rest of my universe.
 
 I looked at my arm. A drop of rain splashed onto it and for a moment I thought my skin was starting to turn transparent. I wondered what my bones would look like once all my outside had faded away. The mud coloured water was up to my skinny knees and rising. Perhaps I would drown before I had time to find out. 
 
  Suddenly I was aware of a warm wind, like I was standing under one of those blow dryers . The rain slowed to a drizzle then the odd drop. As it stopped the wind seemed to wrap round my shivering body and ruffled my hair. I held my arms out and they looked tanned and covered with bramble scratches. I saw that my shorts had a new tear and thought that my Ma would give me hell when she saw it. Then I remembered. Ma was gone, along with Pa and our house and all the rest of my world.
 
  Perhaps it was the wind, but, I can tell you, my eyes teared up and I was fair set to start howling. Somehow though, the wind felt like a warm pair of arms hugging me tight and I felt safe, like when Ma hugged me goodnight. I clung on to that feeling and blinked the tears away.
 
   The wind kept right on blowing and the water I was standing in started to soak away, until I was standing in nothing more than a muddy puddle. Like a film running backwards the colours began to spread outwards and upwards and, after a while I could make out the shapes of familiar objects, like I was looking through a thick fog. The trees became trunks then gradually the trunks grew branches and the glorious autumn foliage reappeared.
 
   I hardly dared look round but, by the time I'd summoned up my courage, there was the wonderful shape of our house. It was still a bit fuzzy round the edges but as I watched the wind blew the last traces of cloud away and up into the sky. The colours spread and seperated and formed into a glorious rainbow arching across a pale blue sky.
 
  I grabbed my shirt full of mushrooms and ran down the lane as fast as I could. As I neared the house I smelled the heavenly aroma of cooking. Pancakes and eggs. The mushrooms would be just in time to add to the feast. I flew in the door and Ma swept me up in a giant hug. 
 
  "" What were you thinking of, going out there in that cloud burst?"" she scolded, "" and what have you done to those shorts?"". I hugged her and hung on to her real tight.
 "" You're soaked through! What have you been doing out in this cloud burst?"" she asked.
"" Oh, nothing much. Just collecting mushrooms."" I poured my treasure onto the table and in minutes Ma had them sizzling away in a pan of lard. I've never enjoyed a breakfast so much in the whole of my life.",A BEDTIME STORY

,"Fantasy, Kids, Happy","The first rain of the season doesn’t seem like much but the plants and flowers appreciate it. Some though find it annoying especially if they have plans that have to put on hold due to rain. Lily, on the other hand loved it when it rained because that was when the rain fairies came out. Not many could see them but Lily could. She would watch them prepare before the rain hit getting animals and insects to safety. Once the rain came Lily would watch the fairies dance and run around the droplets. Occasionally they would direct the rain to flowers or plants that needed more watering. The fairies were tiny little things that flew fast. They were a little bigger than a dragonfly, in fact most people got the fairies confused with dragonflies when they did see them. Rain fairies can fly in the rain unlike other fairies, Lily didn’t know how she figured rain fairies had water repellant wings.
Lily was watching the fairies dance in the rain when suddenly they stopped. Lily looked around to see why and that is when she noticed the cat lurking nearby.
“Oh no!” She shouted running towards the door throwing it open. Just then the cat pounced on the fairies, all flew away but one. Lily ran down the stairs in the rain and shooed the cat away. She looked down and saw that the fairy was injured. Lily reached down to help the fairy but it tried to scurry away.
“It’s okay, I won’t hurt you.” She said picking it up and taking it inside as the rain started coming down harder.
Once inside Lily put the fairy down on the counter and she went to get a flashlight and wash cloth. Lily took the wash cloth and tried to dry the fairy off some, then she noticed the fairies wing was messed up and bent, not torn though. The fairy looked terrified.
“It’s okay,” Lily said again, “I won’t hurt you. I just want to help.” She handed the fairy the wash cloth and to her surprise the fairy spoke.
“Who are you? What do you want?” The fairy said.
“Oh, my name is Lily. All I want is to help you, I notice you come every time it rains and I like watching you dance.” She said smiling.
“Oh. Most humans see us and they want to keep us.”
“Not me, I just want to make sure you are okay before I send you back out there.” Lily said pointing towards the door. The fairy nodded and tried to stand but couldn’t get up right. Lily got the flashlight to try and see how bad the fairy was hurt.
“Do you have a name?” Lily asked, “I don’t want to keep calling you fairy.”
“Aella, they call me Aella.”
“That’s a pretty name. So you have a scratch on your leg and your wing is just bent not torn. So you should be fine.” There was a loud bang and Lily ran to the window, the rain was coming down even harder. Lily looked and saw the cause of the bang was the other fairies trying to look through the window.
“Oh your friends are looking for you. Can you fly?” Lily asked.
Aella managed to stand then she flapped her wings but couldn’t move. Lily held out her hand and Aella climbed in it. She carried her to the window so the other fairies could see her. Soon the fairies were making movements and signals with their hands like sign language. Aella let her friends know she was okay and the other fairies flew off as the rain calmed down.
Lily walked back to the counter and sat Aella down then she went to get something out the refrigerator.
“Um… are you hungry? What, uh, what do you eat?”
“Have any berries?”
“Um, I’ve got grapes. Oh! I have some strawberries too.” Lily replied grabbing them from the fridge and giving them to Aella, who smiled and took a bite of the grape.
 
Over the next few days Lily helped Aella get better and stronger, she even left treats for the other fairies when they came in the rain. Once Aella’s leg got better she could easily get around however her wing wasn’t quite ready so she stayed a little longer. Lily would catch Aella staring out the window especially when it would rain. Aella’s friends would still dance and then would come to the window and see how Aella was doing. Lily would carry Aella outside and sit down with her on the porch when her friends came. Lily didn’t mind the rain or getting wet she loved watching the fairies.
A few days later Aella was fully healed, she was zooming around Lily’s house and was eager to get outside. Lily did notice though that Aella would cover her wings with water first before taking flight. Maybe that was how it worked she thought.
“You’re all better! You can go home now.” Lily said cheerfully heading towards the door.
“No I can’t. I need the rain to fly.” Aella replied.
“You could take some water with you and sprinkle your wings with it if they dry out.” Lily suggested.
“It wouldn’t work. Inside the house I can fly like that because the air is cool and the pressure isn’t high. When it rains the pressure drops and the air is cool and that is how I fly, along with the water of the rain.”
“Oh. I’m sure it will rain soon, it is the wet season.” Lily said hopefully.
 
The days passed and still no rain. Aella was starting to look sad and lonely, without the rain her fairy friends couldn’t visit either.
“How about I take you? I could carry you and you can show me where to go?” Lily suggested.
“That’s sweet of you but no humans are allowed in or near the fairy village.” Aella said sadly.
The next morning Lily awoke with a start, Aella was jumping on her smiling big. That’s when Lily heard it, the rain. Lily smiled, jumped out of bed and ran to the door throwing it open. Sure enough the other fairies where there flying near smiling and laughing. Aella flew straight out the door and spun in a circle enjoying the rain. She came back to Lily and gave her a hug.
“Thank you! Thank you so much!” Aella said as her friends came near. They all circled around Aella and gave her hugs. The other fairies then turned to Lily and hugged her too. Lily was just as happy as she watched the fairies fly off into the rain and start dancing. Then Lily ran out into the rain and danced.         ",Rain Fairies

T/W: paralysis, depression, suicide
 
Trapped From The Inside 
 
I remember the day so vividly. I was a youngster playing around with my toy
soldiers and watching TV. It was Sunday, my sweet day off. No working, just
playing and fooling around all day long.  
 
“Samuel it’s time for breakfast!” My mother yelled across the house. 
 
I got up slowly and reluctantly. I put my toys in a pile at the corner of the room
and turned off the TV. I started heading toward the kitchen. I was just a
few steps away from the kitchen and I could already smell the food, but I would
never have the chance to taste it.  
 
As I entered the kitchen I suddenly felt a sharp jab in my chest. My knees
began to buckle. My hands started violently shaking. I felt nauseous as my
stomach growled and I screamed in anguish. I fell to my knees as my
mother rushed to my aid. 
 
She was repeating “Are you ok? Are you ok?” 
 
I wasn’t. I was panicking and tried to scream again, but I couldn’t even
muster the energy required to whisper. My eyes were now red and watering. My
head felt like it was about to explode violently just like a massive firecracker. 
Then I fell to the ground with a loud thud and I slowly blacked out.
 
I regained my consciousness in an ambulance surrounded by men and women
dressed in yellow and white with the word “PARAMEDICS” written on their shirts.
When they saw me awake they each yelped with joy but not a moment later I
closed my eyes and drifted out of consciousness once again. The next thing I knew
was that I was lying down in bed. My mother and father by my side.  
 
“Mom, Dad I’m ok.” I tried to cry out with delight. But my mouth didn’t move. I
tried moving my legs and arms but I couldn’t. The door swung open and a doctor entered the room with a clipboard in her hand.
 
 “Your son Samuel Houser has entered in what we call a vegetative state. He is
alive but has no connection to the outside world”, she announced concisely
with no remorse or emotion in her voice. My mother broke out in tears, as my father tried to comfort her, but to no avail. 
 
“No, this can’t be happening.” I thought, trying to reject the whole idea. 
 
I couldn’t sleep that night. I could only think of what I had become. Everyone
thought I was dead inside, but I wasn’t. I was just a nine year old
boy and I was trapped in my body. 
 
After a long session of relentless pondering, I was eventually able to fall asleep.
A few hours later I was awakened by a doctor entering my room, pushing a
wheelchair. He smiled painfully, and  lifted me into the rickety wheelchair. He
didn’t even look at me. It seemed I was just an object to him. He then began
pushing me around the hospital. The hospital walls were a blinding white and
the entire hospital was just full of depressed, solemn and bitter people.  
 
After at least a dozen minutes of wandering through the hospital we arrived at the
respective compound that I would be transferred to. I could read the words
“Everbrook Day Care Facility” above the door written in dark red. The doctor
entered the facility and gave possession of me to a 50 year old lady. She had black
long hair and wrinkles that covered her face. 
 
The lady picked up my limp body and dropped it on a couch. She then left and came
back a few minutes later with a machine having a tube attached to it. She inserted a large capsule full of dark brown liquid into the mechanism. She started the machine after sliding the plastic tube carelessly and painfully into my paralyzed, dry mouth. The machine started to ventilate and a second later the brown liquid quickly rushed down my throat. I was gagging as the disgusting liquid choked its way into my body.
 
 
This forceful feeding happened once every 6 hours. Most of the time I was woken
up in the middle of the night to ingest the vile liquid. During the day I would sit on
a couch and wait till it was time for bed. I was helpless and I hated it. The worst
part was when a group of people would pass by me they’d often laugh and call me “corpse”, and “vegetable”.
 
The more time that passed by in the institution the more my mental health
declined. It started to slowly strike like a cold palm to the face that I might never
recover from whatever illness I had. I might never be able to hear
my own voice again or even walk again. Could I ever eat again, or even drink?
 
One day my parents came to visit. I exploded with joy when I saw them but I still
showed no emotion. I saw them talk with a doctor and sign multiple sheets of
paper. After they finished they rushed toward me and gave me a hug. It felt
amazing to be finally recognized as a human for once and not as an item. 
 
They stayed with me for at least half a day. They fed me homemade soup which
tasted astoundingly good compared to the regular slop I was regularly force-fed.
They even talked to me even though I could not speak. Everything was going well
till my mother rushed out of the room in tears. My father then followed suit after
her.
 
“I can’t look at my son like this! He would have been better off dead!” She sobbed.
 
“How could you say something like that?” My father shot back.
 
These words my mother said struck me hard. I started to feel nauseous. My own
mother thinks it would have been better if I had died? A thousand feelings and
thoughts came rushing through my head. I felt like the world was swirling around. 
 
What was the point of living if I didn’t have the ability to do anything? The doctors
thought I would never recover and even my own mother gave up on her first born.
The Everbrook facility had done nothing to help me and seemed to have no
intention of doing so. For me all hope was lost. I started to believe more and more
that I would never recover from whatever illness haunted me. I had lost
all faith in everyone and everything. I truly was alone.
 
Depression started to swoop over me. I could not stand to live this rancid life any
more. I had to end it. I decided to hold my breath. I intended never to breathe
again. I was blinded by the fog of depression and I stopped thinking straight. 
 
A minute had passed and my body was trying desperately to force me to take a
breath, but I stubbornly pushed forward. I started to feel weary and weak. My
eyes and head felt like they were about to implode. I slowly felt my body shutting
off, but suddenly, I was gasping for air. The immediate rush of oxygen exhilarated
me. My brain started to function properly once again.
 
My muscles felt tender and relaxed after the massive contraction they endured.
My failed suicide attempt left me weak and tired, and a few minutes later
I drifted off to sleep.     
 
The next morning I woke up with a rested mind and body. I was still full of pain and
sorrow, but I wasn’t going to end my life. At least not today.

,"Kids, Contemporary, Inspirational","On the first day of middle school, my head was spinning. I got out of bed an hour earlier, crammed pop tart in my mouth, and rushed out the door. I zipped up my backpack as I sprinted to catch the bus stop. The kids on the bus waited to ask me about my brother, 'Super-Duper' Julian. He graduated from the school last June. Julian was an all-star football, soccer, and lacrosse player. And, oh, did I mention, he graduated cum laude. Julian made it seem easy. Everyone in school hoped I'd be the second coming of Julian. To them, I wasn’t Jeff; I was a little 'Super-Duper' Julian. Not that I didn't want to be as athletic or smart as my brother, but I learned early, I wasn't born with those gifts. 
 The next two weeks were horrible. I tried out for all the sports teams. I didn't make one. Out of the ten tests I took, I failed three and averaged low scores on the others. The word spread throughout the school that I was not the second coming of Julian. I was just a regular sixth grader. To many seventh and eighth graders, sixth graders were the lowest form of life.
 One day during recess, I practiced dribbling my soccer in the schoolyard. One of my dribbles hit the side of my foot and bounced towards a group of girls jumping rope. They giggled and tossed it back to me. I smiled. After several more kicks, I missed again. My ball rolled towards the girls again. I turned around and smiled, but no one was standing there. In fact, no kids were around me. What happened? I glanced over my shoulder and saw the answer. The Lobuz brothers, identical twins Jedrek and Aurek, marched towards me. They bullied and terrorized sixth graders. The taller brother, Jedrek, bent down until we were nose-to-nose.
 ""Hey, six grader, me and the other eighth-grade boys wanna play a game of soccer. So you better give up the ball.""
 He reached for it, and I pulled it back and said, ""Not unless I play too.""
 Jedrek straightened and stared at me as if I had two heads. He turned and stared at Aurek, wide-eyed, puzzled. Aurek clenched his fist and shook his head in disbelief. Everyone who heard my answer groaned.
 A student yelled, ""Hey, kid, you got a death wish or somethin'? Give up the ball!"" 
 With his nostrils flared, Jedrek stepped towards me as he pounded his fist into his palm. ""What did you say?""
 I shook as I clutched my ball. I knew what came next. The bloody nose Jedrek gave Timmy when they argued popped into my head. That's how the Lobuz brothers settled their arguments. I closed my eyes and waited.
 ""What is going on here, Jedrek?"" 
 I opened my eyes when I recognized the booming voice of the gym teacher, Sister McCarthy. The students circled us.
 ""I–I was askin', this kid if he and the other sixth graders wanted to play a friendly game of soccer,"" Jedrek explained.
 Sister McCarthy raised her eyebrow and stared at him.
 ""Yeah, Sister, honest. You can ask him.""
 ""Is this true, Jeffrey?""
 Jedrek glared at me.
 I swallowed. ""Y-Yes, it's true.""
 ""Yeah,"" Jedrek scoffed, ""as if sixth graders could ever beat eighth-graders in anything.""
 All the children laughed at the idea. I don't know if my pride made me do it, but I blurted out, ""Oh, yeah? I bet the sixth graders would beat the eighth graders in a soccer game.""
 The laughter stopped, and everyone gawked at me.
I didn’t believe I said that. I thought the eighth graders would kill us. 
 Sister McCarthy smiled. ""Okay, boys, select your teams and meet me on the field.""
 We both nodded. Jedrek and a line of eighth-graders strode off, snickering. I looked at the sixth graders and shrugged. I searched the crowd looking for a familiar face, or someone who looked like a player. Many of them avoided eye contact. I felt hopeless.  
“Come on, kids, raise your hand. I know we can beat them.”
 No one moved.  
 ""Okay, I'll have to pick a team.”
I saw a boy in the third row.
“The boy over there wearing glasses. Do you want to play?”
 He pushed through the crowd and stood beside me.
 ""Hi. my name is Jake."" He said waving his hand. I waved back and continued looking into the crowd.
 ""The boy wearing the Mets' baseball cap and the tall redhead boy standing next to him, do you want to play?""
 They pushed through the crowd and introduced themselves as Austin and Benjamin. Benjamin was cross-eyed; Austin admitted he wasn't a skillful player, but he'd give it his best try. 
 Next, I pointed to a boy wearing red sneakers. As he walked towards me, I noticed he limped. 
 ""My name is Cody.""
 ""Hurt your ankle, huh?""
 He smiled. ""No, one leg is shorter than the other. Thanks, no one ever picks me for any running games."" 
 ""Oh,"" I whispered, turning back to the students. I pointed to a stocky boy in the second row, but the smaller kid wearing a Yankees baseball cap scurried forward. 
 ""Sorry,"" I said as I shook my head, ""I meant-""
He shook my hand and removed the Yankee's cap to reveal bangs and pink barrettes. ""Hi, my name is Ashlee,"" she said, finger-combing her hair. ""Thanks for picking me.""
I blinked and smiled.
 ""S-Sure, Ashlee.""     
 My team was complete. I led us to the field followed by a crowd of solemn sixth graders.   
 The teams joined Sister McCarthy in the middle of the field. She handed my team blue shirts and Jedrek team wore red. The guys on his team were the best athletes and biggest bullies in the school. 
  'Ankle-kick' Aurek, ‘Nuggie' Nate’, Swirly' Sven, 'Teasing' Tommy, and the worst, ‘Take-your-lunch' Ted. They growled and snarled at us to intimidate us—and it worked. We stood slumped shouldered and awed-struck. 
 ""Hey wait a minute. That's Ashlee!"" Jedrek said, pointing at her.
 ""I'm not playing against no sixth-grade girl.""
 ""Does this mean you're giving up the game, Jedrek?"" Sister McCarthy asked.
 ""Naw, I just don't want to hurt a girl.""
 ""Don't worry about me, Jedrek Lobuz. I can take care of myself.""
 ""Okay, Ash-lee Ma-ree, but don't blame me if you get hurt.""
 Sister McCarthy raised her hand. ""Enough. You have fifteen minutes.""
  Jedrek won the coin toss. He threw an overhead pass towards Aurek. Ashlee stepped in front and intercepted it. She dashed away, eyes fixed on the goal. 
 ""Look out, Ashlee!"" I yelled.
 Sven shouldered Ashlee, sending her tumbling. The crowd booed. I turned to the Sister. ""That wasn’t fair, Sister!"" 
 ""Play the game, Jeff.""
 Three passes later, Jedrek's kick soared over Cody's outstretched arms into the right corner of the net. The Red Team laughed and taunted us. 
 ""Ha, ha, ha, that's one goal!"" Jedrek waggled his pointer finger in the air. 
 ""So much for fair play,"" I said to my teammates. 
 We won the next face-off. Austin dribbled down the field, switching from the left-to-right foot. He side kicked to Jake, who darted between opposing players. Patrick's long strides put him on a collision course with Jake.   
 ""Look out, Jake!"" a few kids in the crowd yelled.  
 He didn’t hear over the crowd noise. Patrick's grin widened with each stride. He lowered his shoulder and launched into his body. Jake slowed to push up his glasses. Patrick howled as he flew by, with arms and legs flailing as he tumbled through the grass. He sat up, dazed, with blades of grass in his hair. Startled, Jake stopped running. Benjamin swooped by and kicked the ball down the field. His path to the goal was clear. The goalie looked into Benjamin's eyes to see where he to kick the ball.  Benjamin's crossed eyes confused him. The goalie dove left; the ball went right. We scored. It was our time to celebrate. 
 We battled up and down the field for the next ten minutes. Neither team could score.
 ""Score tied at one with one minute to play!"" Sister McCarthy announced.
 Both teams dug in their heels. Faces grimaced. Bodies strained.  
 Aurek and Ashlee ran side-by-side, elbowing each other, both kicking the ball. He tugged on the back of her blouse. She stumbled, and Aurek gained control of the ball. He raced down the field. We ran behind complaining, but the roar of the crowd drowned us out. Aurek lined up the ball and kicked it. It spiraled through the air like a baseball pitcher's screwball. Cody shuffled his feet, trying to stay in front of it. He lost his balance and fell. My heart sank. Cody scrambled up, jumped, and batted the ball away.
 ""Ten seconds!"" The Sister called out, staring at her stopwatch.
 There was no time for celebration.
 In his haste, Cody tossed in a weak one-bounce pass to me. I stepped on the ball twenty yards in front of our penalty box. The crowd screamed, ""Kick it, Jeff!""
 ""Five seconds!""
 I moved to the other side of the ball.
 ""Four seconds!""
 I lined up the ball.
 ""Three seconds!""
 I drew back my leg back as far as I could.
 ""Two seconds!""
 With one second left, my foot crashed into the ball. The thud echoed through the spring afternoon air. 
 Jedrek yelled, ""You don't have a prayer this far away!""
 Everyone watched in eerie silence as the ball soared past midfield. Jedrek stopped laughing when the ball sailed across the penalty line.
 ""Oh no, the ball's headin' straight for the goal,"" Jedrek moaned, falling to his knees. 
 The goalies' outstretched and straining fingertips scraped the descending ball.
 ""It's a goal!"" someone cried in the crowd. ""The New Kid kicked the ball three-quarters of the field into the goal on a fly!""
 The ball grazed the top goal post and careened out of bounds. Game over. The game ended in a tie.
 I sat on the field, hanging my head. Cheering and clapping came from the sidelines. Eighth graders, I thought. I looked up, and all the sixth graders were rushing onto the field. They were leaping up and down. My teammates helped me to my feet. I turned to Ashlee and groaned.                                  
 I turned to Ashlee. ""Why are they celebrating? We didn't win.""
She patted me on the back. “We sixth-graders never even came close to beating the eighth-graders at anything, ever! 
 ""Yeah,"" Austin added, ""you should have seen the fear on their faces when they thought you kicked a goal. Priceless.""   
 Everyone patted me on the back and shook my hand. Ashlee smiled and said, ""Yeah, Jeff, no one will ever forget this day or your kick… Thunder foot.""
 Everyone cheered, ""Thunder foot! Thunder foot!"" as we marched back to the school. The Legend was born.                ",The Legend of Thunderfoot
,"Fiction, Kids","	I stood in front of the body and stared at it for a while. A lifeless corpse…...i wondered how it felt….being alive one second and dead the next. As I looked around I saw everyone around me in tears crying and wailing over the body. They must've cared for her. She was pretty and whenever I saw her she was always with someone. It was typically a man….though I didn't see any of the man she was with at her funeral so that was a bit odd but I didn't think much of it.
	“I am so sorry Ren she cared for you so much!”, my aunt said in tears as she embraced me in a hug. The woman in the coffin was my mother. My oh so caring mother who barely said a word to me in my life and whenever she did speak to me called me a demon. As my aunt cried while hugging me I stayed silent and stared at my mothers body. I wasn’t quite sure what exactly I was feeling. It wasn’t sadness….it wasnt relief either. I was feeling a bit curious. How it felt to be alive with your heart beating and then the next second dead. It was interesting. I was there when she died. She was in the hospital and the last thing she told me was that I was a demon. I didn’t feel anything when she told me that. And then she took her last breath and stopped breathing then and there, her eyes wide open staring at me….staring into me.
	The rest of the day went by with people talking about how loving and caring my mother was. Then they put her in the ground and buried her.
	I sat in my aunt's car as she said goodbye to everyone who came to my mom's funeral. My aunt offered to take me in even though she already had 3 kids herself. Her husband worked far away. I agreed and now here I was. I wondered what everyone was feeling while they were crying. They seemed to be in a lot of pain as if they needed to go to a doctor. I didn't really get it. I never did to be honest. My Mom loved me. Sometimes she got mad and hit me but sometimes she hugged me. I liked it when she hugged me. My mom's emotions changed fast and she drank a lot. Though still I loved my mom..she was pretty and warm. I think she hit me because she needed something to let out her anger on. If that was me I was fine with it as long as I was of some use to my mom.
	My mom called me a demon…...I was different. One day she took me out to the park and I saw a bird bleeding out with its wings torn off. When I saw that I felt sorry for it so I stomped on it until It stopped moving and making sounds. I put it out of its misery. When my mom saw what I did she was horrified. That's when she started calling me a demon. The kids at school called me that too because of how I acted and I had red eyes. My eyes scared my mom too. I had blonde hair like my mom. I don't really know where my eyes came from….my mom didn't have them. I guessed that they came from my dad’s side….though I’ve never seen my dad. My mom says that he's dead.
	My aunt pulled me out of my daze as she opened the car door and sat in the driver's seat. “I really am sorry Ren. You don't have to hold it in, you can cry if you want. Your mother was a really wonderful person. She was the best older sister.”, as my aunt talked she started crying again. I looked away from her and started to think about my mom. I really did love her. She was pretty and even though she hadn't done it in a while I always liked it when she hugged me. It was warm. She brought a lot of men home though….and whenever she did she locked me in the closet. I didn't like when she did that but I did like my mom. As my aunt regained her composure she looked over at me and her face full of tears soon changed quickly as she looked at my stoic face. It was the same face my mom gave me. If I were being honest I think I was glad my mom was dead…..she was always crying when she was alive and when she was in the hospital bed she looked like she was in pain. She was put out of her misery.
	My aunt looked at me horrified. I looked up at her and after realizing her expression I quickly began to cry. I learned over the years that this was the best course of action. Or else people would think I was ‘weird’. 
	“M-Mom”, I hiccuped as tears came out of my eyes. I looked back at my aunt and her horrified face was gone as tears began to fill her eyes again. I spent the rest of the drive fake crying until I fell asleep.
	“Ren honey we’re here.”, I woke up as my aunt shook me to wake me up. The sun was beginning to set. I quickly unbuckled my seatbelt and jumped out of the car. I was too small to step out.
	“Ok Ren I know you must be anxious but don’t be. My children are very nice. They’ll be happy to have a new addition to the family. You’ll be their new younger brother.”, My aunt said as she gave me a warm smile. I liked her. I nodded my head as I followed her inside the small house.  
	“Mom, your back!”, I heard as soon as my aunt opened the door. A small girl who looked around 11 hugged her. “Hi Sarah”, she said, returning the hug. Was this what a normal family was like?  
	“Who’s he?”I heard a boy who looked around 15 ask another boy who looked 14 standing next to him. They looked intimidating maybe it was because they were taller than me,
	“This is Mia’s son, he's going to be living with us now.”, as she said this all of their expressions changed. They didn't look happy. After a few moments they all looked over at me and smiled.
	“Hi, your name is Ren right. You're our cousin, I’m really sorry about your mom….”, The 14 year old boy started. The girl embraced me in a hug. As she hugged me I paused for a second not knowing what to do. It felt nice and warm. And then out of nowhere I started to cry. I didn't know why exactly but I burst into tears and didn't stop. I wasn't even faking it. I was confused but at the same time not. I guess I did miss my mom after all.  
	The next week went by with the 3 siblings making me feel welcomed. They really were nice. I had to change schools too. I didn't really have a problem with it because everyone in my old school was weirded out by me. My teachers liked me though since I got good grades. I remembered things easily so I didn't have to try very hard. My teachers actually asked my mom to have me skip a grade but she refused.
	“Ren It’s your first day of school are you excited?”, My aunt asked me, giving me a warm smile as she knelt down to meet my eye level. I nodded without saying anything and she smiled.
	Me and Sarah walked to school together. I liked Sarah. She gave me a lot of hugs and sometimes slept with me because she was afraid I would be scared of the dark. I wasn't afraid of the dark though. I found it interesting….it was as if I was entering a different world whenever i couldn't see…..as if the darkness was embracing me. A world full of darkness…...It felt nice and warm. Though I didn't tell Sarah that because I liked it when she slept with me because whenever she slept with me she always hugged me.
	“Ok Ren we’re here!”Sarah said enthusiastically. “I have to go to my class so I wont be with you. I know you don't like talking much but try to be friendly ok!”She smiled at me again. I nodded silently. As Sarah waved and walked away from me I determined in my heart to try my best to make friends…..I wanted Sarah to like me.
	“Hello, you must be Ren.”, a middle aged lady with brown hair said as she gave me a warm smile. I nodded and she flinched when she looked at me...it was probably my eyes. Though she quickly regained her composure.  “Come I’ll introduce you to the class and don't worry, all of the children here are very nice. I stared at her and nodded without saying anything.
	“Hello class!”, I heard the woman say. “Today we have a new student, Ren. Please come in.”, as she said that I began to walk into the classroom and looked around. All of the kids were staring at me. I didn't feel uncomfortable or nervous. I felt determined.
	I introduced myself and sat down next to a girl with brown hair. “Hi, where did you come from?”, she asked me as she stared at me. Then she screamed. “Your eyes!! Teacher, his eyes he's scaring me!”, then she got up and ran to the teacher with tears in her eyes. I sat there not really knowing what to do. That girl was annoying. I didn't like her. 
	The boy in front of me turned to look at me. “Your eyes look pretty cool!”, he said and he looked like he meant it.
	“Thanks”, I said after staring at him for a second. The rest of the day went by with the teacher teaching. The girl that sat next to me switched seats with someone.
	I played with the boys during recess. They didn't seem disgusted by my eyes. I didn't feel anything towards them though. I didn't hate them and I didnt like them.
	“Hey Ren!!”, Sarah said as she ran over to me. “So how was school? Did you make friends?”, she asked. I nodded my head and in response she patted me on the head. I felt happy I liked Sarah.",The Funeral
,"Horror, Crime, Kids","TW: violent murder
 
The car screeched to a halt. Two masked figures jumped out. They were carrying a gagged and tightly bound man with bulging eyes and a look of horror on his face. The masked figures carried the captured victim to a small grove of trees on the left. Apparently I hadn’t been noticed, yet…
 
Who were these people? What were they doing with the tied man? Curiosity was overwhelming me. I knew what the consequences would be if I got caught spying on them, but I couldn’t resist the temptation. I needed to find out. Besides, a tiny peek wouldn’t do anything would it?
 
I dived into the overgrown bush. It was the perfect hiding spot and at an angle peeking at all the action. I watched as the masked figures dropped the body on a decaying rampike. One of them took out a rather ominous-looking but magnificent knife. It glinted in the setting sun, and shone with a menacing gleam. I almost gasped. They wouldn’t, would they?
 
The bound man knew what was coming. He looked so petrified; I had never seen someone like that before. His face showed a grief-stricken expression and his eyes watered. His body trembled, and he let out a stifled cry. Then, suddenly, with no warning or hesitation, the masked figure stabbed its unfortunate victim. That cursed blade sunk deep into his guts. Only its awe-striking hilt arrogantly stood out.
 
I watched the essence of life drain out of him as he died, with the blood slowly seeping from his body and engulfing him in a dark pool, ever-increasing every second. I had never seen anyone  in such excruciating agony. He clutched his side, desperately trying to scream out but ghastly muffled by that horrendous gag. Then he was just still, completely unmoving. As still as a statue. No raspy breathing could be heard anymore, or stifled moaning. He was gone from this world, never to return. But what haunted me the most, was his very last expression before his death. He was looking at me.
 
Then the masked people quickly dug up a large hole, buried the body and left, as quickly as they came. I waited until the loud hiss of the car engine faded away before I dared to venture out. I was horrified, startled and witless. This was scarring. Trembling, I felt chills running down my spine. My body was shaking and my head suddenly felt too heavy for my neck. I felt sick and revolted. My legs gave way and I was left on the ground on my knees. The nausea made my stomach churn and its contents uncomfortably rise as I forced it back down.
 
I couldn’t believe that the murdered man had seen me. Actually seen me. The guilt was eating away. Here I was, a kid who had just witnessed a major crime and stood there bamboozled on what to do. His expression, when he was looking at me, oh that expression, is something I’ll never forget that. A mixed look of pure terror, horror, pain, shame, pride, sadness, anger, how can it be described? He was terrified about what was happening and how he was dying, in unbearable pain, and on top of that seeing me watch him like that just aggravated his already damaged mental state. But what can I do about that now? I mean he’s dead, so of course it was a pity, but I can do nothing feeling guilty at the moment. Of course I should’ve called the police, but it was a dangerous situation, and the fear and stress had stopped all my rational senses. Besides, it was dangerous with such vile and murderous killers nearby, who would definitely terminate my existence if they found out I was there and what I had saw. In fact, I really was lucky to escape the scene and save my life.
 
It was twilight, and gloom slowly enclosed around me. My senses were coming back, and the first thing I did when the shock had passed over and my limbs had returned to their natural state, was run, run all the way home as swiftly as I possibly could. I sprinted through the streets like I was being chased by a monster. That was what it felt like. Some monster was chasing me. The monster was my own fear, my own insecurities and cloudy guilt.
 
A slight drizzle had started, and I submerged in a feeling of overwhelming melancholy. It was strange, I didn’t even know myself how I was suddenly so dejected. What had happened was not in my control, I tried to convince myself. I couldn’t have done anything, and what’s done is done now, I should try and forget what I had witnessed and move on with my life. It had nothing to do with me and therefore would not affect me at all, provided I didn’t replay the scenario in my mind a million times and drove myself mad.
 
I reached the porch, and pressed the bell. At that moment, a sudden wailing sound filled my ears from behind. A shadow cast over the lantern on my door in front of me. I turned around apprehensively, only to perceive nothing. My mother opened the door and saw my fearful look.
 
“Are you alright”? she asked. “Oh, um yes, I just thought I saw a bat”, I quickly retorted. She nodded sympathetically and I went into the house. I knew I could count on that excuse to pass over any discomfort. She knows that I absolutely loath bats. We don’t see them too much here in the outskirts of Sydney, but of course they do come around occasionally.
 
 I ran up the stairs to my room and tucked my flute away in the cupboard next to my bed. I had a lot to practice from my teacher and I decided to get a start on it tomorrow. “Hi Pepper” I called to my gerbil. She immediately bounded up to me. I opened the cage door and let her out. “I know you don’t like being trapped in a smelly cage all day long little fellow”. “I don’t like it either”. “If I had my way, I would never lock you up”. Unfortunately, dad would’ve gone bonkers if Pepper was loose. “I don’t want anything to do with that filthy rat, you hear that Fornax”? “Keep it away from me”, he would always tell me.
 
Then I went to shut the window, when something peculiar caught my attention. I stopped in my tracks. There was something uncanny and deeply unsettling outside. I hesitantly crept forward and leaned against the glass. The glass was cold as I pressed my nose against it, squinting in an effort to discover what it was I had seen. My heart was about to explode out of my chest. There was nothing obviously disturbing in sight, but something seemed off about the environment outside. The uneasiness was ceaseless. Then, out of nowhere, a spectral jumped at me on the other side of the glass. I recoiled, startled.
 
The spectral had torn clothes, and was glaring daggers of pure malice into my soul. He was tightly bound in coiling rope that had burnt into his ragged skin, forming hollow impressions and red stripes all over. It was him, again. That malevolent ghost was the same man whose death I had just witnessed less than an hour ago.
 
I took a good long look at it, retreated slowly to see if it was following me, and then ran down the stairs at superspeed. Was I safe nowhere, not even in my own home? I shuddered at the thought while I went into the sitting room. Why were all these things happening to me today? I kept glancing behind me to see if it was there again. But I’m too old to still be believing in ghosts. It must’ve been my wild imagination and subconscious mind that was playing tricks on me. I mean, this experience shook me to my very core so it’s natural that I would hallucinate a little right? It would go away as the memory faded.
 
Or that’s what I thought. Supper with my parents went fine, and I was able to comfortably enjoy our conversations, but at night when I went to bed, it was worse. The torment I was facing from witnessing the murder was deeply disturbing me. Anxiously I was kept on my toes the whole night as I waited to see if the spectral would return. What if the ghost got me? Ghost. Ghost? What ghost? What I saw was just a figure in my mind. A hallucination. Thirteen was too old to still be believing in such fairy stories. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t.
 
My vigilance ensured insomnia that night. I woke up all groggy and dishevelled with low energy and I didn’t even feel like getting out of bed. But though I was sleepy and tired still, I couldn’t stay longer, my restlessness was getting unbearable. I got out of bed, got dressed and  went downstairs. My heart stopped cold when I saw what was on the television. It was the picture of the murdered victim, before he got murdered. He was everywhere, in my mind’s eye, in my nightmares and now in the public too?!
 
It was on the local news channel that my parents watched every morning. I sat down shivering, even though it was a typical thirty degree weather. The goose bumps on my skin shone out like strawberry seeds as a dreaded anxiety creeped over me.
 
The news channel reported that the new detective Carl Jenkins (the man I had watched dying) went missing, and that the police were searching without any trace of where he disappeared. I’m the only one that knows then, I thought to myself.
 
The next few days were abominable. I had hallucinations of the spectral all the time, and I kept getting distracted in class. I didn’t know it would bother me this much. The delusions of the murder that had conjured up in my mind were ceaseless. No matter how hard I tried and what I did, I couldn’t get that out of my head.
 
I remained highly solitary and reticent at school, seldom talking with my good friend Robert. Poor chap, he was confused about my sudden odd comportment. I didn’t have the heart to tell him anything, mainly because I knew he wouldn’t believe my thinking of the ghost, being a very rational person. If 
 had heard this, they would conclude that I was fantasising, because “ghosts don’t exist”. But then again, my conscience didn’t tell me to spread the word so I could convince everyone I was a lunatic. This was obviously going to be kept private. By now I was unquestionably certain that the ghost was no figure of my imagination. I knew it was real.
 
Less than a week after that horrid incident, my second encounter with the poltergeist happened. I had just switched off the light so I could sleep, (and repeatedly checked that the window was bolted firmly), when a faint murmuring started. I tried to figure out where the sound was coming from, but just then my eyes felt a painful pang. I couldn’t see anything at all. Then a hushed voice started talking. I tried to find out where it was coming from but then I realised in horror that it was emanating from my head, from me. I was possessed by someone. I breathed desperately as the suffocation rose.
 
“Close your eyes” said the voice. Unresistingly, I obeyed. A face zoomed in my head. It was of course, the horrendous face of that murdered victim. “Surprise, Fornax Asher Ottum” he said in a deceivingly soft voice. “You remember me, don’t you, you pompous dwarf of a boy”? He snarled maliciously. “I’m Carl Jenkins”. “Why did you watch me die? Why didn’t you call the police? Why didn’t you stop them? Why didn’t you save me”? He boomed.
 
“Forgive me, but what could I have done”? I said nervously. “If I had interfered, I would have died too”. “I can’t resuscitate you”. I felt that deep inside, the ghost knew this was true. Nevertheless he continued to take out all his frustration on me.
 
“Listen boy” the ghost hissed from my head. “I lived a lonely life. It got better at the end, just in time for me to die and forget what happiness felt like”. He looked downwards and I saw the sadness in his eyes. “I grew up in an orphanage with no friends. The kids didn’t like me, the supervisors didn’t like me, the teachers didn’t like me, I had no one. No one at all. When I turned eighteen I started working in a supermarket. A few years later I got my beloved Pixie, a lovely Persian cat, my only source of happiness. My soulmate. I worked at that supermarket for fifteen years, before I got the detective job from the police. It was my lucky day. I found the loot from a gold shop in Dubai that was smuggled all the way here in Sydney”! Said Carl proudly. “The police were amazed at how I had done that, it was no accident I assure you, and impressed with my critical thinking and method of action they didn’t even ask for qualifications! I had that job for only five months before those wretched gold thieves killed me, revenge for ruining their plan. They knew me personally, you see, and they weren’t able to let it go easily. They accused me of being a sociopath, a manipulative lone fiend who messed up everything”. His voice dropped and I heard stifled sobs.
 
“Why are you telling me all this” I asked Carl. “Why are you haunting me”? I finally managed to croak, hoarsely. “When will you stop pursuing me?” “That’s the second part” he said. His voice had undergone a 360 degree change. Where it was emotional, heartful, nostalgic before, it had completely changed to sadistic, manipulative and evil. How was it humanely possible to undergo such a change? “The twist. It is quite simple, dear” said Carl, gleefully. “All you need to do, is trap the two assassins. Trap them, turn them in to the police, so they get incarcerated, and even better, hang. Then I will go back to my grave in peace. You won’t hear from me again. But if you fail, I will be all there with you all your life. I will be there with you during school, in your dreams, with your parents, all throughout your childhood. I will be there with you when you graduate school and get a job, when you find a partner, get married, have a family, whatever. I will be there with you always, and there is no way you’ll ever be able to get rid of my wrath. No way out, except death. Suicide. I ensure you, I will drive you deranged to the point where you will be forced to take your own life to escape the disastrous reality you have brought upon yourself”.
 
My suspicions were confirmed. Not only was this ghost real, but this man was a classified lunatic. Obsessive, controlling and utterly mad. Plaguing a kid rather than sorting it out with the killers. Feeding his self-absorbed elusive ego.
 
“Let me give you some information about them that I found out” said Carl Jenkins. “The two criminals are twins, Orion, and Delphi Paver. As children they were inseparable and fell into a crowd of older malicious kids. They learned to steal, and later to kill. They learned how to stay anonymous, lie low, and get away with crime. A lot of crimes that are shown in the newspapers or the television are done by them. The police have been out and about searching for the criminals, but in vain. No one alive has ever seen the rascals before. They don’t live in one place for long, and constantly move about. They make deals with crooked people, brainwash the treacherous ones, and get away with everything. Only once have the police seen two faint silhouettes in the distance, only to lose them again. They are masterminds, and to play a game with them is dangerous”. finished the ghost.
 
“How do you know all this”? I asked Carl. “I am a spirit now, and spirits can travel faster than light itself, into the past and the present” he replied. “Besides, it was part of my case study as a detective to investigate into them, so I was starting to get information about those cursed fugitives”. “What about the future”? I questioned curiously. “As a spirit, do you know that?”
 
“No one knows the future, for anyone can change it, anyone at any time” he said sagely. “Why don’t you tell all this to the police, or perhaps the Paver twins” I asked, irritated that he should bother me. “The Paver twins are not afraid of anything” he said spitefully. They are darker than darkness itself. And it is easier for a ghost to manipulate a child rather than an adult police officer, said Carl Jenkins. I did not understand what he meant by that. Obviously if he revealed himself with such tormenting images and threats to an adult, however more influential and high ranked in society, he’d get the same effect. Fear knows no age. “Goodbye” said Carl Jenkins. “You have a fortnight to finish the business”. Then he roared and I felt his presence leaving. The coolness and clamminess of the air disappeared with him. I could breathe again.

,"Friendship, Sad, Kids","	“I AM GOING DAD, IT DOES TAKE A WHILE TO WALK FROM THE BASEMENT TO THE ATTIC!” Athena shouted as she slammed the trap door to the attic. “God he could be a real pain in the butt sometimes.” Athena said as she began looking around. “Time to clean up I guess.” Athena said as she began picking up boxes and moving things around. An hour later, Athena has cleaned up everything except for her mom's chest, it's been 4 years since she looked through her stuff. She sighs and begins opening the chest knowing her father would yell at her once again for being nosy. The trap door to the attic opened and Athena quickly turned around to see her best friends Lily, Davy, and Damon. “For the love of irene you scared the gumballs out of me, I thought you were my dad!” Athena whispered. Damon rolled his eyes as he shut the trap door behind him. “No need to get scared just us, our family decided to come early for something your dad has planned.” Damon said as he sat down near the trap door. “Yeah my dad said it was something life changing and blah blah.” Lily said as she gave a little smirk. I rolled my eyes and looked at Davy. “What? You know you have a staring problem.” I said as she scoffed. “No you do, now what are you hiding from your dad?” Davy asked. “Oh I'm just looking through my mom's old stuff, I haven’t had the chance since we moved here.” Athena said as she gave a sad smile. “Your mom was really cool, always getting us out of trouble.” Damon said as he moved closer to the chest. “Yeah and scaring the living heck out of my dad for me.” Lily said as she giggled. “Yeah it was really funny everytime her and my dad got into play arguments.” Davy said as she touched the chest. “Yeah she was really great, want to see what's in her chest? I mean she was basically like yall family too.” Athena said as everyone moved closer to the chest. Everyone nodded as Athena opened the chest. “I guess we found out where you got your junk hoarder personality from?” Lily said as Athena playfully pushed her. As everyone looked through the chest, Davy saw something strange. “Hey what is this?” Davy said as he found a secret pocket in the chest. Davy pulled a black and white photograph from the pocket. Damon snatched it from Davy and looked at it. “Wow, this looked ancient. Who are these people though?” Davy asked as Lily snatched it from him. “I can only recognize Athena mom but not everyone else?”Lily said as Athena tilted her head. “Wait there is something written on the back.” Athena said as she grabbed the photograph and flipped it around. “The Future Dimensionals.” Athena stated. “WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?!” a voice said from behind them. They all turn to see Athena Dad's head peeking out from the trap door. “ALL FOUR OF YOU COME DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!” Athena Dad said as we all scrambled down the attic. “D-Dad! H-Hey I um finished cleaning up and saw mom's chest and we found this in a secret pocket!” Athena said as she showed him the photograph. Athena Dad looked confused and quickly grabbed the photo. “Why are you screaming Agapov?” Damon's mom said as she came up the stairs. “Oh shoot we are done for.” Damon whispered as the rest gulped. “If you're gonna call me by my last name at least say it fully Barnes-Agapov” Athena Dad said as he looked at Damon Mom. Damon's mom gasps as she sees the photo in Athena Dad's hand. “No way, she still had this!?” Damon Mom said as she grabbed the photo from Athena Dad's hand. Damon Mom looked at it and tears began to spill. “Mom, are you okay?” Damon asked as he went over to his Mom and held her hand. “Yeah I am let go downstairs to await Lily and Davy Dad.” Damon's mother said as they went downstairs. Athena, Davy, Lily and Damon sat down on the couch as Athena Dad and Damon Mom began talking.A while later. “Hey we are back and bought stuff for the BBQ!” Lily Dad shouted. Lily Dad and Davy Dad walked in.“What's going on?” Davy Dad asked, confused as he set all the bags down on the table. Damon Mom got up and showed them the photo. “She still had it! The kids found it in a chest she had.” Damon Mom said as they both looked at it. “Are we in trouble, I can’t tell.” Lily whispered. “I can’t tell they look happy, mad, sad, it's too much!” Davy whispered. “Athena, how is ya dad looking?” Damon whispered as Athena turned to her dad. Athena Dad had a blank expression on his face.“I have no idea, he has that scary look when he has mixed emotions. I haven’t seen that face since my mom died.” Athena whispered back. “HOLY CRAP THIS WAS THE PHOTO WE ALL TOOK WHEN WE HIT A MILLION! WE WERE SO HAPPY!” Lily Dad shouted, causing the children to jump. Athena Dad got up and walked towards the group. “She told me about that day, she was so pumped saying that y'all dreams were coming true.” Athena Dad said as Damon Mom nodded. The adults began whispering and chattering. “WAIT IM LOST ARE WE IN TROUBLE OR NOT!?” Damon shouted as everyone looked at him. Damon Mom then walked towards Damon and hit the back of his head. “You're not in trouble.” Damon's mom said as Damon dropped his jaw. “THEN WHY I GET HIT!?” Damon shouted as Damon mom hit the back of his head again. “You are shouting inside someone else's house that aint your.” Damon Mom said as Damon slowly nodded and sat down. Athena's dad then sat down across from us. “You guys are not in trouble, I was a bit angry when you guys were looking through the chest but you guys have every right to.” Athena Dad said as Lily Dad sat down next to Athena Dad. “We are gonna tell you a story, a lovely story about silly kids who have been together forever and achieve their dreams.” Damon mom said as she sat down next to Lily Dad and Davy Dad sat to the right of Athena Dad. “Those silly kids are in this picture and have achieved their first goal in life together.” Lily Dad said as he slid the photograph across the table. “The girl in the middle that is taking the photo with the biggest smile is Athena Mom, who is known as Lady_Writer but to us is Elena.” Athena Dad said as Athena smiled. “The guy that holding his head and is freaking out and looked like he was pacing that me.” Lily Dad said as Lily looked shocked. “I was known as TheSoulBoarder, but to my family I'm just Adam and of course the father of Lily.” Adam said as he chuckled at Lily's reaction. “DAD YOU WERE ONCE COOL!?” Lily shouted as everyone chuckled. “Hey watch it Lilith!” Adam said as Lily sat back with a pout. “Anyway the girl you see jumping in the mid air, well she was jumping on the couch and screaming out. That is I. People used to know me as SenpaiSammy but I am just Sam and mom to Damon.” Sam said as she giggled. “Man, that was the time when we weren’t old and had the ability to move, must have sucked for you Adam back then.” Sam said as Adam slowly turned to look at her. “Oh really?! At least I didn’t hit my head against the fridge back then.” Adam said as Sam gasped. “YOU WERE THE ONE THAT HIT ME WITH IT!” Sam shouted as Adam shook his head. “NO! I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.” Adam said as Sam glared at him. “Okay okay enough you two! It's my turn.” Davy Dad said as he rolled his eyes. “The guy that is grabbing the shot glasses and drinks is me, back then I was known as 00110100 and so on, but I'm just the father of Davy and a simple but fabulously Garrett.” Garrett said as he laid back. “So hold up your telling me that our family is basically famous secret youtuber, writer, skateboarder people?!What next you gonna tell me that my father is in the mafia or something?” Athena shouted as she looked at everyone. “Athena….I am just a simple business man, in all reality when your mother died Garrett, Adam, and Sam died they stopped filming and took simple jobs.” Athena's father said. “It's a lot to take in but we swore to each other if anything ever happened to us we all wouldn’t continue. So we shut down our channels and the Dimensional one.” Sam said as she slowly got up. “Now we are family people with good paying jobs and an amazing family, we wish we had when growing up.” Adam said as he walked towards the table with the stuff. “I still think Athena's father is in the mafia, because look at you guys new house.It so big for just the two of you.” Lily said as she nudged Athena. “Well about that, we have news. It has been four years like we promised and we decided that we all are going to move in with each other.” Garrett said as he put an arm around Athena's dad. “DAD ARE YOU SERIOUS THAT THE BEST!? WHY DIDN’T WE MOVE SOON!?” Davy shouted as she got up from the couch. “We were waiting for everyone to move their business here, for example is my bakery,Garrett construction business and Adam video game company.” Sam said as she went to go help Adam. “Wow this is amazing, come on guys let's go outside and party!!” Damon shouted as all the children ran outside. Athena Dad grabbed the photograph and was heading upstairs. “You're going to put it back?” Garrett said as Sam and Adam followed the children outside. “Yeah….maybe take the chest out and put it in my bedroom.” Athena Dad said as Garrett sighs. “She loved you very much Chris, you may not show it but it still pains you to even hear her name doesn’t it?That's why you didn’t want Athena to be looking through her stuff” Garrett asked as Chris took a deep breath. “Athena reminds me so much of her everyday, the smile, the attitude, the goofiness, the curiosity, it's just rough that she is not here.” Chris said as he looked at the photo. “You know when I moved in with you guys, she wanted to raise the kids together and we would get to be the big family that we always wanted.” Chris said as he sighs. “Well here we are doing that, maybe now she could rest in peace finally knowing that you and Athena aren’t alone anymore.” Garrett said as he took the picture from Chris and left it on the table. “We never were alone….” Chris said as he put his arm around Garrett and headed outside.
	“Is it on?” a voice said. “Yes, let's do this!” another voice shouted. “Hi I am LadyWriter2, and I am here with Skatergirl, Gmoney and SenpaiDamon. We are here to tell you the story of the original Dimensionals and how we became the future Dimensional in honor of our parents.” Athena said as she looked at Lily, Davy and Damon. “We are Future Dimensional~!”

,"Fantasy, Kids, Inspirational","“Most Valuable Indeed!” Fable – 5/9/14; Revised 7/19/2021 to fit the word count.
“It is me! It is me!” shouted the cheetah. “I am the quickest of all the animals in the Animal Kingdom; I have the speed and agility. I raced up to the summit of Mt. Everest in less than 3 hours.”
           The owl hooted, “Oh please, cheetah. You would not last a nanosecond in a game of trivia. I won 
 and 
 ten times each.”
           “Quiet!” roared the lion. “It is I who possess power and strength like that of the Sun. I’m in a popular Disney movie: 
. ”
           “While I would not even dare rival the power of three creatures of highessst virtue, I believe the mossst cunning belongs to me, not you. I’m in the most widely published book: 
. ” hissed the snake.
The animals with the most exceptional attributes (excluding humans) were debating over who deserved to be known as “The Animal King”—the greatest honor in all of the Animal Kingdom. The cheetah, the owl, the lion, and the snake — being the quickest, the wisest, the strongest, and the cleverest respectively — dominated the scene at the Wild Wisteria – an area where marine, jungle, grasslands, forest, desert, tundra, taiga, and freshwater biomes coalesced – with their onomatopoetic sounds (i.e. hoots, roars, and hisses). 
Meanwhile, the other animals wallowed in grief, for their combined prowess, adroitness, and abilities fell short of the top dogs. The animals, however, all possessed one vote each. And each animal was represented with one organism of their respective species. Hence, once the owl, the cheetah, the lion, and the snake had finally exhausted themselves of every last breath, a small but determined ant stepped—or in this case, crawled—to the front. 
“Ahem,” coughed the ant. “I am an ant. I am tiny; I am small. Be that as it may, but I speak for the others—the not so bright, the not so fast, the not so strong, and the not so clever.” The ant turned its head, regarding his audience. “Take donkey for example: he may seem slow to grasp concepts, but his perseverance and endurance prove to be a true wonder.” 
The donkey whinnied in approval. 
“And turtle. She is notorious for her slowness, but I believe her patience is something we all can learn from.”
The other animals sounded their approval in a chorus of clicks, oinks, buzzes, hoofs bleating, heads ramming, and fins splashing. The snake sank back into a coil; the lion stood its ground, but it shook beneath him; the owl ruffled its feathers—its eyes wide; and the cheetah pawed its head in dismay. The best had been bested.
“And what about me? I may be small, but I am an ant. And for that I am grateful.”
*Application: Value does not come from the individual. It comes from God. Practice being humble, for arrogance has no place anywhere—neither in the Animal Kingdom nor elsewhere. Instead of searching for value outside of yourself, search for value from within. Tame yourself, work on developing your talents and skills to a higher degree, and remain as positive as you can be, without sounding fake or looking like you’re forcing a smile.
Indeed, in this story, many characters are searching for signs, whether astrological signs or validating, instant gratification signs. Impressing people shouldn’t be your end-goal; rather, we must work in concert and in harmony with one another, as each animal has importance. Each animal serves a purpose (well, maybe not flies, mosquitoes, or cockroaches). Similarly, each human being deserves attention, care, and respect. The moment we stop giving that to someone, the moment we lose their respect and their love. Of course, it may not have as much a sense of finality as that, but it can still have a sense of permanence.
The owl may be seen as wanting a more perfect wisdom—one where he is supreme and idealized. This may be his tragic flaw, causing him to not be that wise after all, especially after the ant gave his opinion. The snake is cunning, which is not necessarily the same as wise. Snakes have forked tongues, demonstrating their malleability and double standard; they can entice, persuade, and woo any soul, even Eve in the Garden of Eden. The cheetah is basically a racecar that never runs out of fuel. Of course, this is a hyperbole, as it is a fictional story with bits of fantastical elements, as the animals can talk. The lion, who is in the same taxonomical family as the cheetah (Felidae), yearns for masculinity and showmanship.
Fables are a genre that were in their peak with Aesop. We, too, should reawaken prior genres with renewed hope and vigor—a freshness unlike any other, a crispness of paradigm proportions. As you can tell, I really love to write. Please follow me on my social media platforms, if possible. I want to bring people along for the ride, the journey into the metaphysical realities and the paranormal deities that are exhibited within each of us. I want to lift us all up into heaven through clarity, encouragement, and hope.
Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and author, stated, “Just as despair can come to one only from other human beings, hope, too, can be given to one only by other human beings” (Brainyquote). Hopefulness makes the tiniest leaf seem larger in significance than the shiniest diamond.
So, don’t stop believing. That song by Journey is one that reaches into the inner-city kids, who live in crowded areas and depraved areas sometimes, and the country folks as well. Yet, industrialization also brought newfound wealth to many people, like Andrew Carnegie and Rockefeller, and farms can be really successful, too. Anyway, enough of the history lessons. I sometimes forget that I shouldn’t be a WyzAnt tutor in every place on the Internet; there’s a time and place for everything, and teaching should be done in schools or through a tutoring company, not on Reedsy. Anyway, I’m so grateful that I can be on this platform with so many esteemed editors as workers here and so many esteemed and aspiring writers here, like me. ",Most Valuable Indeed!
,"Horror, Teens & Young Adult, Kids","	My name is Zack William; my job is a bone chilling job. I hunt ghosts, inspect paranormal activities and visit haunted houses to see what’s going on there. Most of the houses I visited had some common ghost sighting, (things flying off, seeing a shadow person, tiny orbs flying around the house, etc.) but the last house I visited was one of the scariest haunted houses. 
	First of all, “How did I become a ghost hunter?” Ever since I was a kid while living with my family, ghosts and poltergeists had really interrupted our family for 2 years straight. Fire alarms went on in the middle of the night, a shadow person, papers burnt (especially my homework), furniture flipping over, etc. So, that’s why I work as a ghost hunter. I want people to live by themselves without any interruptions by the ghosts.
	Anyways, the story begins with a knock on the door of my office room.
	“Knock, knock.” Someone knocked the door. “Come in, the door’s open!” I shouted as soon as I heard the knock on my door. The chief came in with a clipboard in his hand.
	“Mr. William, I have a new case for you!” The chief said handing over the clipboard to me. “I’m always ready to help people chief, you can count on me!” I said without looking at the details on clipboard. “This isn’t a common haunted house. 5 of our teams rejected after 30 minutes there, but if you insist.” The chief said and left the room. I grabbed the clipboard and look at the details on the clipboard.
	
	
	
	
	
	I haven’t seen a code red as long as I can remember. Maybe because of it never happened. I packed the gadgets and gears I need and went to the van where I will be living until the case is over. I went to the entrance door with a backpack full of stuff. As soon as I touched the door handle, the chief called out to me.
	“Mr. William, before you go I wanted to say something.” The chief said. “What is it?” I asked. “When you get there, you will find your coworker. His name is John Watterson.” The chief said. “I will be sure to meet him sir.” I left as I said that.
	--2 hours later—
	After 2 hours of driving, I felt tired. I got to the house and saw another person there waiting for me. He called me as I parked the van.
	“Are you Mr. William?” He asked. “Yes, I am. You must be John.” I replied. “Yes, pleasure to meet you.” He said and we shake hands. “So, how long have you been here?” I asked John. “A few minutes ago actually. I found this note on the floor.” John said as he gives the note to me. It reads” Stay out of here. If you come in, you will regret it.” It was written in bad hand writing. 
	Before I go in, I take a look around the house. It was a 1 story house made with wood planks which are painted white. There is only one door which is at the front of the house. There are pieces of paper scattered around the lawn. The old tree at the front of the house has no leaves. From the two windows at the front of the house, I can see the living room and a kitchen. I asked John to come with me and help.
	We opened the front door, it made a squeaking noise as we opened it. “John, switch on the lights while I plant cameras.” I whispered to John. I don’t want to make any noises in this house. 
	We can see the living room on the left and a small kitchen on the right. There is a long hallway leading to three doors. The master bedroom, another bedroom and the bathroom. It’s a small house.
	I planted the cameras and sound detectors in every room of the house as John came with me turning on all the lights. “This is the last room John, turn on the lights.” I whispered to John. The lights started to flicker on and off as I planted the last camera. We both looked back at the front door as the wind pushed the door open, carrying the pieces of paper we saw outside. The papers formed into a word on the floor saying “I warned you!” The lights turned off and the windows are closed. we can only see the front door which is reflected by the sun light.
	“Run John, run!” I cried. We both run to the van and drove it to down town. I started the engine and drove as fast as I can until we got to down town.
	“Mr. William, are you okay?” John asked. “I’m fine, you?” I asked. “I’m fine.” John replied. “That was one strong spirit. I’m not going to give up that easy.” I said to John. I'm completely terrified, but I still want to clear that house. ""I’m a bit scared, but I will give it one more try, I guess.” John said.
	That night, we came back to the house. We parked the van on the other side of the road. The right side of the van was facing the house; from the front and the back of the van, we can see the dim light road.
	“It’s 9:30, we can get a closer look on the ghost and maybe even hunt it down.” I said to John. John was looking at the cameras and the sound detector. I can see he was really concentrating on catching the ghost on camera. 
	The wind was cold outside and very dark. I was at the front of the van fixing the thermal camera. Minutes later I saw a man walking across the road. I took a closer look at the person and found out he was a soldier with a firearm. He walked pass the dumpster which covered his whole body. I waited for minutes to see if he would come out but he never did. So, I decided to check it out.
	“John, I’m going to that dumpster over there really quick!” I said to John as I put on my coat and made my way outside the van to go and investigate. I stepped out of the van and felt the cold breeze of the night. I felt cold and scared; I slowly made my way to the dumpster. As I approached to the dumpster, the street lights began to flicker and turn off. I felt something touching me from behind so I quickly looked back and saw nothing. I quickly looked back to the dumpster and found a man standing one leg. He looks like a normal man but only has one leg. I froze in fear, he was jumping right to me with his only leg, I quickly turned around and run for my life.
	I didn’t look back, John was shouting at me, telling to come inside. He saw the creature behind me. I made my way in the van and I start the engine. “Step on it!” John cried. The one leg man was in front of the van, pointing behind us and quickly hopped away. We stared at each other and looked back to see a giant 9 foot tall man crouching inside the van, covering our only exit. John pounded the front windshield of the van to break it open. 
	The man was getting closer, I give the windshield a hard pound and it broke to pieces. We jumped out of the van and run to a safe place.
	 After a few days, I went to my office and went into the chief’s room. I opened the door without knocking. “What is it Mr. William, everything alright there?” The chief asked. “I have bad news, can I quit the Job?” I asked and never returned after that bone chilling experience.","""Experience the horror!"" by Ye Wint Aung"
,Kids,"Amy was a dream girl. She loved to read books and thought of herself as Anne Shirley. The only difference was that he didn't have freckles and red hair.
Amy always had pleasant dreams and wished they were right.
She had only one friend in the orphanage, who listened to her big, unfinished words.
 
-I dreamed that my mother came to Mrs. Cooper's office, hugged me, and took me back home.A cottage in the middle of the forest and cherry trees. It was in pink and white, decorated with cherry blossoms.
Maple and apple trees are planted there and they talk to me.
Oh you don't know how dreamy and wonderful was it.
Do you know? I was very disappointed when Mrs. Cooper woke me up. I said to myself ""Oh God doesn't see me at all. I am like an ant that does not bark at me.
Then I closed my eyes so I might see it again, but I couldn't.
He said these words with regret.
-Do you think my dream can be true? 
Jennifer thought and replayed ""No. Whenever it is possible to see the sun at night, your mother will follow you.
But Amy didn't laugh. She wanted her dream be right.""
-Amy. Come here please.
Amy walked over to Mrs. Cooper, who called her.
Yes?, Amy said.
-Someone wants to see you.
-Why?
-You will understand.
She entered the office behind Mrs. Cooper.
She could not believe it, her mother was sitting in front of her, and she was crying ""My daughter!""
-Mother! I missed you.
She jumped into her mother's arms. Her hug was like a soothing pill.
The hug was warm and pleasant. Just like her dream!
The mother took her daughter by the hand and said, ""We are leaving here.""
Amy was happy and cheered.
They left the office. Mother showed a photo of their house. A pink and beautiful house, just like his dream. Amy shouted, ""God, never wake me from this sleep!""

The hug was warm and pleasant. Just like her dream!
The mother took her daughter by the hand and said, ""We are leaving here.""
Amy was happy and cheered.
They left the office. Mother showed a photo of their house. A pink and beautiful house, just like his dream. Amy shouted, ""God, never wake me from this sleep!",Real or dream?

,"Kids, Science Fiction","“How much is this spaceship?” Arnold asked the man behind the counter.
“Doesn’t it have a price tag?” The man asked.
“If it has, I can’t find it,” Arnold said.
“Let me take a look at it.”
The man behind the counter took the toy from the boy and examined it closely. He didn’t remember ever seeing the object in the toy store, nor in any catalog from which he ordered his merchandise.
He pretended checking his computer, and then lied: “Ah, now I see! It’s an item from our old stock. We don’t sell those anymore. You can have it for the bargain price of twenty dollar.”
Arnold put a twenty-dollar bill on the counter and the man put it in his pocket.
 
“What’s happening?” Captain Ant asked when he entered the bridge. “I was just having lunch when everything started to shake.”
“A boy discovered our hiding place on the top shelf of the toy store,” his first officer answered.  “He just bought us for twenty dollars.”
“Does he know he has bought a real spaceship?”
“I don’t think so,” the helmsman answered. “He thinks we’re a toy. He doesn’t know there’s a crew inside.”
“Give us a visual,” the captain Ant commanded.
The blank wall on the bridge changed into a screen on which the images captured by different cameras were projected.
“Enlarge camera five,” captain Ant said. “I believe we’re on a bicycle. The kid is probably driving us to his home.”
Captain Ant was right. The boy stopped at his house, took the spaceship under his arm, and brought it to his room.
“He’s putting us on his bed, Captain,” the helmsman said. “We’ll have a soft landing.”
“Unfortunately, we don’t know what he’s going to do next,” Captain Ant said. “We have to avoid that he does further damage to our ship. Can we project a message on the ceiling of his room?”
“I’m on it,” the first officer responded.
 
Arnold couldn’t wait to tell his best friend about the cool new toy he had just bought. He left the spaceship on his bed and ran outside to fetch Jimmy who lived next door.
“What does it do?” Jimmy asked. “Does it have lights? Can it make noises?”
“I don’t know,” Arnold answered. “It didn’t come in a box; there wasn’t any manual.”
“Wow,” said Jimmy when he entered Arnold’s room. “It can project words on the ceiling!”
“
” Arnold read out loud.
“What does that mean?” Jimmy asked. He clearly didn’t understand ant language. He took the spaceship from the bed and shook it heavily.
“Don’t do that!” Arnold warned him. “You might break it.”
 
“We have to make him stop doing that,” Captain Ant yelled. He barely managed to keep from falling off his chair. “Weapons officer, do we have a torpedo ready?”
“We have four torpedoes ready to fire, Captain,” the weapons officer answered.
“Let’s fire one, but make sure you don’t hit any of the kids,” Captain Ant ordered.
“Understood Captain, I’ll try not to hurt anyone.”
The weapons officer pushed a button. He didn’t aim for the ant farm in Arnold’s room, but it was a direct hit nonetheless. The glass shattered, dirt and ants covered Arnold’s desk.
 
“Look what you’ve done,” Arnold yelled. “You must have pushed a button to shoot a bullet. Now all my ants are escaping.”
“I didn’t do anything,” Jimmy defended himself. “The spaceship did it all by itself.”
“Put it down,” Arnold said. “Let’s clean this mess up first.”
“That’s no fun,” Jimmy whined. “I came here to play, not to work.”
He put the spaceship back on the bed and looked at the damage the torpedo had done.
“All your ants are escaping,” he said.
“I know,” Arnold complained. “We need something to put them in.”
 
“They’ve left the room, Captain,” the first officer reported. “But the torpedo had an unexpected result. It freed an army of ants from a glass farm.”
“Can we communicate with them?” the Captain asked.
“Yes, we’ve kept on projecting messages,” the communication officer answered, “and unlike those kids, they seem to understand what we say. They are marching towards us as we speak.”
“Open the hatch, we have to let them in before the boys are back!”
 
“What a mess!” Arnold’s mother said. “I’ll clean it up for you, on condition that you both get out of the way.”
“But where are the ants?” Jimmy asked. “They’re all gone!”
“Mom, can I stay at Jimmy’s house tonight?”
Arnold didn’t want to sleep in a room with a farm full of ants on the loose.
“If it’s OK with Mrs. Campbell, it’s OK for me,” Arnold’s mom answered.
“Come on, Jimmy, let’s go to your place!”
“OK, we can play with your spaceship at my house!”
 
“We’re on the move again, Captain,” said the helmsman.
“You don’t need to tell us, helmsman, we can all feel it,” the Captain answered. “I hope the newcomers don’t mind being shaken around. What’s the status on them?”
“The leader of the group informed us that every ant from the farm is on board, Captain,” the first officer reported. “He’s very grateful to you. He wants to meet you to thank you personally.”
“I want to meet him too,” the Captain smiled, “and ask him and his team for help.”
 
Arnold and Jimmy played with the spaceship all afternoon. They were disappointed that it no longer showed any special effects, but that didn’t spoil the fun. They had no idea the vessel had an actual crew, nor that this crew was praying for the boys to stop jolting them around. Mr. Campbell came to the rescue not a moment too soon when he called the boys to the table: “Dinner time!”
After having washed their hands, Arnold and Jimmy joined the rest of the family Campbell for dinner. They left the spaceship in the kitchen.
 
“It looks like all the humans are gone, Captain,” the first officer said.
“Thank heavens for that!” the Captain answered.
He had gone over the plan with the leader of the ant farm several times. The group of workers that were liberated from the farm had been divided into different units. One unit went to the kitchen to collect sugar crystals, the fuel of the spacecraft; another unit searched for tools and spare parts in the garage; a third unit was tasked to fix the damaged ship. Each unit executed its task with military discipline.
“The ship is almost repaired,” the leader of the ant farm told the Captain early in the morning. He was very proud of what his workers had achieved. “It’s almost time to say goodbye.”
“My offer still stands,” the Captain said. “We can take you with us on our voyage.”
“That won’t be necessary, Captain,” the leader said. “We’re not of the traveling kind.”
“I understand,” the Captain answered. “I thank you for everything you’ve done for us, yet there is one more thing I’d like to ask you.”
 
The next morning, Jimmy and Arnold couldn’t find the spaceship anywhere.
“It can’t have flown away on its own,” Mrs. Campbell said. She couldn’t have been more wrong.
When Arnold returned to his room. He found a twenty-dollar bill on his cushion.
“Let’s go to the toy store and buy something else to play with,” he told Jimmy.
 
“Mission accomplished,” the leader of the ant farm said, as he watched the boys leave the house to spend the money his elite team had recuperated from the man in the toy store. He looked at the sky and wondered which adventure his friends from space would experience next.",Ants from Space
,Kids,"Hopie sat waiting. She just knew that they would be back. After all, it had only been a day since they had left. They would be back. They had never left her before. But something seemed different.
She looked around the house and saw that the couch she loved to sleep on was gone. Her dog leash was gone. Her food dish, water bowl, all gone. In fact, everything in the house seemed to be gone. Where had her owners gone?
Hopie had the most amazing owners, Charles and Nicole. They had adopted her when she was just a few months old. They did everything with her. They played games, took her on car rides, threw toys around the house. Life was good. But now they were missing. What had happened to them? Where could they be?
She took another look around the house. She walked into the living room, but it was empty. Then she wandered to the kitchen, also empty. Finally, she looked in the bedroom and saw that the bed was not there either. Everything was gone. Worst of all, Charles and Nicole were gone too.
Hopie sat and thought about what she could do to find them. Where would she look? They were not in the house so she would have to look somewhere else, but where? She walked to the doggy door at the back of the house and went outside to the back yard. They were not there either. What should she do?
She started sniffing the yard to see if she could pick up their scent. She walked around to the front yard. Normally, she would not have been able to do this, but they had left the gate open.
As she looked around the front yard, she noticed another alarming reality. Both Charles and Nicole’s cars were gone! This never happened when they left together. Hopie began to panic.
She thought long and hard and realized that her owners were gone. Really gone. But they could not have left her on purpose. That did not make any sense. No, they loved her dearly. They must have forgotten her. Fear set in. 
, she thought,
It was settled in her mind. She would go on a search for her beloved owners. But how would she find them? Where would she look? Where could they possibly be?
She thought for a minute, 
 She knew where the park was, so she darted down the street and headed four blocks down to the city park. She ran and ran as fast as she could, but when she got to the park her owners were not there.
, she thought, 
She looked around and saw the church that her owners attended. She knew the location because she was once recruited to be a pet in the Christmas play that the church put on every year. So she ran down the street to the church and looked around the building. But there was no sign of Charles or Nicole, and their cars were not in the parking lot.
She headed back to the street but did not know where to go next. Why could she not find them? Where could they be? Did they just not want her? 
, she thought. She knew she could not let fear get the best of her. She must keep searching.
Back to the street is where Hopie headed next. She looked up and down the block and headed to the Barber Shop where Charles would get his hair cut. She had been there before with Charles and Nicole. Hopie had waited outside with Nicole while Charles got his hair cut inside. As she arrived, she sat outside and looked in the window but did not see either of her owners.
She was crushed. She had thought for sure that she would find her owners by now, but they were nowhere to be found. 
 She did not know what to do. There was nobody to help her. She was abandoned. She was alone. The only thing that she could think to do was to head back home.
Hopie hung her head and walked slowly back to her house. This was it, she was all alone. What was she going to do for food? Where would she get water? There was a puddle near the house today, but what about tomorrow? And worse, who would she have now for a companion? Charles and Nicole had been her owners since she was just a puppy. She had known nothing else. And now they were gone.
. She could not get the word out of her head. She still did not want to believe it, but reality told her she must accept it. Her owners were gone.
She arrived back at the house, went through the gate to the back yard, and through the doggy door into the deserted home. 
, she thought,
Hopie began to cry and whimper. She wanted to be loved. She wanted someone to scratch her ears. She wanted someone to throw her toys around so she could run and bring them back. She wanted her couch so she could lie beside Charles as he read a book at night. But none of that would happen now. She was all alone, and Charles and Nicole were gone.
The sun was now setting, and it would be dark soon. Hopie walked into the master bedroom where her bed used to be. Another empty room. She laid down in the corner and cried herself to sleep.
A few hours later, Hopie was awakened by a commotion outside. She heard a car door slam and feet rushing outside. Someone was coming to the door!
 she thought. She ran to the door, barking wildly! She started jumping up and down barking with all of her might, paws scratching at the door. 
The handle turned, the door opened, and in walked Charles and Nicole! It was them! They had come back for her! She knew that they would not forget her forever. She knew they loved her!
She tackled Charles to the floor, licking his face over and over. Charles laughed and gave her an enormous hug while scratching her head and back.
“We came back for you Hopie!,” cried Charles, “We are so sorry we forgot you! We would never leave you on purpose!”
Hopie was so happy! Her owners had not forgotten her completely. They came back for her. They loaded her up into the car and drove across town to their new home.
As they got out of the car, Charles opened the door and let Hopie into their new house. She ran into every room. She found her toys; she found her food and water bowls; she found that wonderful plush couch that she loved so much. Charles and Nicole looked at her and just smiled.
“We could never forget our little Hopie,” Nicole said with a tender smile. And with that, Hopie went to the bedroom, crawled in bed and went to sleep content and loved.",Hopie's Long Day
,Kids,"	elizaBEEth was ready to go with the first sign of light. Even if the sunlight didn’t wake her up, the sound of her thousands of sisters buzzing their wings did the trick. 
	This was the way every day started. As soon as the sun went up, the sisters began their work. Some were guard bees, keeping watch day and night over the entrance. elizaBEEth looked at those stationed out there today. Good. They were the same ones from last night. She was always sad when new ones were there, because it meant something happened to them overnight. 
	Other bees started tending to the larvae. Larvae are the young brothers and sisters who don’t look like bees yet. They kinda look like worms. 
	“I used to be like that,” elizaBEEth thought to herself.
	elizaBEEth used to work in the nursery, but now she had graduated to food gatherer. After a couple months of feeding the babies, putting wax over their cells, and making sure little bugs didn’t get into the nursery, bees graduated to food collection.
	She was excited about the promotion, and she adapted quickly, just as all her sisters did. She knew it was a more dangerous job; in fact, many of her sisters didn’t come back in a given day. But everyone needed to be fed, so she took the risk gladly.
	That first day, her sisters had danced for her, so she knew where to find the food. Bees don’t talk to each other. The only noise they make is by buzzing their wings. But when they want to give directions, they do a special dance that directs other bees to the food. Humans call the dance a “waggle.” 
	elizaBEEth had been on food duty for a couple months, but today, she was going to direct some new searchers who had graduated from nursery duty. So she lined up a couple of newBEEs, and did a dance. Oh, it was so beautiful. She went left twice, right three times, then spun halfway around, back to the front, spun again, then stopped. The learner bees immediately flew out of the hive and toward the flowers.
	Now it was time for elizaBEEth to leave. She walked past the nursery bees, gave a goodby look to Momma Bee, who was busy (as a bee) laying eggs. Then there were a couple of drones, BEEnjamin and BEErian. They sat near the entrance, eating honey. elizaBEEth didn’t like them too much. But she and the other workers cleaned up after them and fed them anyway. She knew they’d leave soon. Drones never came back from their first flight.
	Out the door she went, flying high. She rose above the wooden fence, and she made a  bee line (literally) for a lawn full of dandelions. Dandelions are a great food source for bees, because they are plentiful. They spring up quickly, and they cover a lot of area in only a matter of days. 
	So she landed on the bright yellow flower, and she packed her bags on her legs with pollen. 
	“Momma will need the protein to make baBEEs,” she thought to herself. 
	Next, she stuck her long tongue down into the flower, sucking up the nectar. She flew to the next flower, when a loud noise interrupted her. A large, red machine with spinning blades was coming right for her. The human behind it was cutting up all the plants; flowers, grass, weeds all went under the machine and came out shorter. The tops flew out the side and into a bag.
	elizaBEEth hurried out of the way of the machine and looked for a new yard. Fortunately, the neighbors were out of town. So she alighted on their lawn and got several dandelions’ nectar and pollen. 
	Now she was thirsty. She needed some water to mix in with the nectar so she could make the honey. Oh, good, this yard has a pool. She liked people who had water out for her. Sometimes it was a pool; sometimes it was a bucket of water; sometimes people even put little rocks in the bucket so the bees could stand on them and get the water without drowning.
	Man-made water sources are safer for the bees, because lakes and streams and ponds attract dragonflies. elizaBEEth lost several of her sisters, who collected near the lake, each day to the dragonflies. 
	Today, she had a pool. Nice and clean. She sat on the edge of the pool, and put out her tongue to get some water. Something moved the water in the pool, causing a wave, and it knocked elizaBEEth into the pool. 
	If she could talk, she would have screamed. But she paddled as well as she could, trying her best to breathe. Her wings stuck to the water, so she couldn’t move them at all. 
	It only takes seconds for a bee to drown, so she was lucky that the pool boy was there. He reached with his net on a stick and brought her out of the pool. He put her on the ground, and she sat still a couple of moments. She let the sun dry her off, and then she was on her way. 
	She found several more flowers, and put more pollen in her bags and drank more nectar. Soon she was headed home. 
	She went straight there, but she always kept a watchful eye out for birds, cars, anything that might kill her before she could get back to home and drop off her honey.
	She landed in front of the door, and went inside. She found some open wax cells and threw up inside them. Once she did that, she fanned her wings, so she could dry out the excess water. Now she had perfect honey, and she put wax on top of the cells to keep the honey safe. It’d be used by nursery bees to feed the baBEEs, or it would last until winter time, when they’d all eat it. 
	elizaBEEth looked out the door. The sun was still up, so she flew outside and started her flight all over again. ",elizaBEEth's day
,Kids,"By Heather Ann Martinez
 Voices could be heard crying out from the tallest mountain to the deepest cavern. Doubt spread like a merciless virus no one could control or contain. The Master heard the pleas of each one. The Master cried alongside them. The Master sent them a comforter and yet the Master’s children could find no peace. The children struggled. They feared. The children thought they were abandoned from time to time. They could no longer feel the presence of their Master. They eventually stopped trying and if anyone asked if they had, they would pretend to be like everyone else. They thought the Master did not care for them as promised. The children wanted the Master to do something for them, but they did not know what exactly. The children knew they could not go on only experiencing the agony of defeat. They blamed the Master for not doing enough. They fought against each other hoping the Master would see which one amongst them loved the Master most. Although the Master tried to teach the children that they were all loved and cared for, the Masters words were not received.
It was not always like this. There was a time when the children looked for their Master. They invited their Master for dinner and talked with their Master at the start of daybreak. They shared their jokes, their joys and their struggles with their Master. He knew them and they trusted him for the most part. The children who had children of their own knew how difficult it was to keep their babies safe. As time went by, each generation went further away from the Master’s ways. They wanted their independence and freedom to do whatever they pleased whenever it pleased them. The Master sent messengers the children quickly rejected. When the messengers started talking about rules or how their ancestors once looked up to the Master, they turned away. There was no one left who remembered sitting at the Master’s feet.
For years, the Master looked at the children from a distance. The Master knew they would continue to reject any of the Master’s representatives. The children had become angry and fearful. They did not trust anyone that looked like them or talked like them. The Master thought about this for many days. The Master decided to write a letter to the children. The Master chronicled memories of their ancestors, of telling jokes, and sharing bread and fish by a campfire. The Master expressed how much the children were missed and how much he loved them. They were his pride and joy even if they had forgotten him. The Master knew they were in pain now and wanted them to know they did not have to go through that pain by themselves. He ended the letter by inviting them to a banquet.  All they had to do was accept the invitation. All they had to do was leave the bickering and fear behind. Their warring and boasting were not welcome at this table. This was a banquet of peace and safety.
After the Master wrote this letter, he thought about what or who should deliver it. The Master looked all over his workshop for something or someone that would grab the children’s attention and make certain his invitation was delivered. He heard a moan come from underneath his stool and stood up. When the Master stood and looked down, he laughed. 
The Master picked up the small hound puppy in the palm of his hand. The puppy was shaking violently. He couldn’t believe the Master was holding him.
“Where did you come from?” The Master asked.
“I’ve been here a while, Master. What was it you were writing?” The puppy asked.
“I wrote a letter to the children. I wanted them to know how much I miss them and love them. I invited them to come to a banquet. I’ve missed laughing and eating with them. The land used to be full of laughter and dancing. The children used to trust me and look up to me. We used to look forward to seeing one another. We were happy.” The Master continued.
“What happened?” The puppy nestled more firmly into the Master’s palm.
The Master told the puppy that the children turned away from the Master, that they chose a path of fear and anger. The Master said that many of them hung on to hurt and offense as if they were badges of honor. Many of them could not leave the past alone. The forsook the Master and opted to find their own way in the world even though their way was more difficult. The Master promised the first children he would be there for every generation after. The Master remained faithful to that promise even though the children rejected his messengers and comforter.
“How are you going to deliver the letter Master? I’m sure the children will want to come to the banquet.” The puppy sat up attentively.
“I was looking for a way to do just that when I saw you. Do you want to deliver my letter, little one?”
“Yes, and I would be happy to.” The puppy barked and jumped.
“I wish it were a simple task. There will be a lot of things that will distract you from delivering my message. You will have to stay on the course I lay before you. You will be tempted. The children can spend days, months and years finding things that entertain them. They lose track of time. I want you to know that you are not carrying this burden on your shoulders alone. I will there whenever you need me to be.” The Master said.
The Master rolled the letter and placed it in a capsule bound to a collar around the puppy’s neck.  The puppy complained that the capsule itched as it periodically scratched against his fur.
“Have you a name?” The Master asked pretending that he did not already know it.
“Shoulders, my name is Shoulders.” The puppy barked with excitement.
The Master set Shoulders on the path to the city where the children lived. The Master reminded Shoulders that it was a far distance and he would have to stay on the path to reach everyone who needed to receive the invitation. The Master told him he would have to go through the forest, across the bridge and over a mountain range to reach those he loved most. The Master also reminded Shoulders he did not have to carry this burden by himself. He could cry out for help and the Master would come at his beckoning.
So Shoulders set out for the city. He did not realize how far the city was from the Master’s dwelling. He did not know there were children that lived in the forest and along the mountains. As Shoulders entered the damp dark forest, he was greeted by deer and several pairs of human eyes. They did not know what to make of him.
“Who are you?” One of them asked.
“What are you doing here?” Another one asked.
The puppy began barking but no one understood him. Instead, they became frightened. They ran away deeper into the forest. Shoulders tried to chase after them but the weight of the capsule exhausted him. When Shoulders realized he was no where near the path he was set on, he began trying to turn back. Then, he saw a neon lit sign: 
.
Even though he could not read the words of the sign, he followed the arrow in the direction it was pointing to. He thought it must mean something important since it was in the forest. As Shoulders got a little closer, he realized the forest was no longer full of trees, ponds and grassy nooks. There were houses, stores, restaurants and lots of the Master’s children. Instead of barking, Shoulders decided to rub against someone’s leg. He faked a paw injury and began moaning.
The child, a woman, picked Shoulders up and began petting him. She opened the capsule and read the letter. She thought it was a joke. She put Shoulders on the ground and pushed him away. She didn’t want anyone to think she had fallen for the prank. Shoulders moved on from her and eventually from the forest. He was tired and hungry. Eventually, he laid down. He tried removing his collar and the capsule. He didn’t want to do this anymore. He thought delivering the message would be easy and now realized that this was going to be harder than he could have imagined.
Shoulders began rolling as he struggled to loosen his collar. He landed in the mud at the edge of the river. He began crossing the bridge. Some children walked passed him and did not notice him. Shoulders stood in the middle of the bridge. He looked at the moon and hoped the Master would hear him say he needed help.
The Master heard Shoulders and sent three messengers to meet him on the bridge. The messengers were tall heavenly creatures that looked like the Master’s children but they were peaceful and dressed in long while robes. The reminded Shoulders this burden was not his alone to carry and one of them picked Shoulders up in the palm of his hand. As they walked, another messenger had food for Shoulders and the third had water. The four of them made their way through the mountains and finally to the city where most of the Master’s children resided. The messengers left Shoulders there.
Unlike the children in the forest, the children in the city did not run away from Shoulders. In fact, they suspected that the Master would be sending someone or something their way. They had been crying out for mercy. One of the men of the city opened the capsule from Shoulder’s collar. A crowd of people had begun forming around him and the small puppy. The man read the Master’s letter out loud. After the man read the invitation, one said:
“Well, if Ranger is going to be at the banquet, I’m definitely not going.”
Another said:
“I will only go if I sit at the head of the table.”
Another said:
“I’ll only go if I can post photos of me talking with the Master on social media.”
Five others said they would go to the banquet after their gaming tournament. Ten others asked if the banquet food could be delivered. They said they didn’t have time to spend with the Master.
One young boy announced that he would go to the Master’s banquet and he would bring his sister with him. Shoulders guided them back to the Master’s dwelling. They took their places at the banquet. The food and the companionship of the Master was more than they could have hoped it would be. They remained with the Master and others followed after them. The Master kept his promise. He never left them or forsook them. Shoulders stayed with them ushering each generation to the banquet. Shoulders reminded everyone that even though the journey is long the love at the end of it makes the journey worth it.
  ",Shoulders
,Kids,"I lifted my head out of the garbage can, wrinkling my nose at the awful smell of the place. The smell of smell of rotten eggs enveloped the air. I looked around at the whizzing cars and the drunkard sitting next on the cement nearby, whiskey in hand.
Vomit made it to the edge of my throat, but I managed to hold it in. The streets whirled around me, making me dizzy. I struggled to pull myself out of the garbage can and fell flatly on the pavement.
I looked at my paws.
I sniffed.
My heart sunk. My owner, Jeanine, always told me I was the best dog ever and that she loved me. She thought I couldn’t understand her, but I could. I looked around. Cars whizzed by, first a white Subaru, then a green Nissan, then a Prius. I sighed.
It had all happened that morning when she had been taking me for our regular walk in the dog park. I had seen a stranger with dark black hair and a mustache, drinking brandy as he was walking a huge, black dog named Burly. I rolled my eyes at the thought.
He’d always barked at me like I’d done something wrong and nipped at me. My whole body shivered at the thought. I smelt the pavement.
I furrowed my brow, trying to make sense of my surroundings. Large sky scrapers towered above me. A big, black dog rushed by, snarling at me and nearly knocking me over. I barked. I barked again and again, but Jeanine wasn’t here. I couldn’t cross the street with the cars whizzing by and I wasn’t sure where on earth my best friend was. I sighed and laid down on the pavement, dejected. My lids became heavy and closed in their sockets. The world went dark.
The next morning, a golden disc of light rose in a sky of many colors. For a second, I became lost in the divine painting of the horizon: orange, purple, hints of blue, and a pink streak across the sky. I shook my head and snorted.
Suddenly, I spotted Jeanine’s favorite pastry shop across the street. I guessed I hadn’t seen it before.
There was a stoplight though, if I walked for a few a few miles. I knew that because Jeanine had always crossed the street with me when she was going to her favorite pastry.
I told myself, even though I was so hungry it was hard to walk. I’d eaten most of the stuff in the garbage that was any good anyways, but my stomach was a bit upset. I missed my grain-free dog food that Jeanine always gave me, and the bacon, and the salmon.
My mouth watered just thinking about it, and I resolutely put one paw in front of the other, breathing heavily, until I reached the traffic light and the crosswalk. Of course, with my luck, the sign on the other side of the street was displaying an orange hand, so I waited, and waited, and waited for what seemed like an eternity until I saw the white stick figure on the sign. Then I ran across the street as fast as my little legs could carry me. It was hard being a small dog sometimes. People didn’t see me and I didn’t want to get run over. Jeanine would be devastated. I really wanted to see her again. My heart ached.
I smelled the sidewalk for her scent. It smelled like a lot of people, of course, but, as I got closer to the familiar pastry shop, I detected it.
I ruffled my nose, as determined as a son searching for his mother in the grocery store, and continued my search. A light bulb went off in my mind.
The sun beamed down on me. My tongue was hanging out of my mouth.
I thought, but I just kept going, one paw in front of the other. Jeanine usually carried me part of the way if I got too tired, and it had taken me a long time to find the familiar pastry shop.
I kept walking, and, after what felt like an eternity, I finally arrived at my best friend and owner’s apartment. 1134 Blackweld Place.
“Dumb dog. What are you doing here?” a gruff man with greying hair shouted and kicked me.
I whimpered. Jeanine opened the door. There were large bags under her eyes. She was holding a phone in her hand.
She dropped the phone on the floor and ran outside, “Plato! You came home. I was so worried about you. I’m glad you’re okay!”
She picked me up and held me in her arms, tears streaming down her face.
My nose wrinkled. I smelled salmon on the stove. Jeanine put a perfectly roasted piece of fish into my food bowl and I devoured it like a hungry bear.
I drank my entire bowl of water as if I hadn’t drank anything for weeks and collapsed onto the floor, my lids closing.",My Jeanine
,"Fantasy, Kids","I woke to the sound of pebbles tossed against my window. I looked at my clock. It was two in the morning. Who would wake me up this way at this ungodly hour? I got out of bed and opened the window. At first, I didn’t see anyone in the front lawn.
“This isn’t funny,” I said in a suppressed voice. “Your prank worked. You got me out of my bed. Now show yourself! Don’t be a coward!”
“But I’m here, don’t you see me?” a tiny voice whispered back. “Wait, I’ll put my light on.”
Something started to glow in the dark shadows of the boxwood. I blinked my eyes when I saw the creature that was responsible for interrupting my sleep. I felt the urge to pinch my arm.
“This must be a dream,” I said to the creature. “You don’t exist.”
“Everything you can imagine is real,” the creature answered. “You imagined me when you were younger, therefore I’m real. Can I come up to your room?”
“Maybe it’s better if I come downstairs,” I replied.
 
Carefully not to wake up my parents, I took the stairs down. In the kitchen, I poured a glass of cold water and took a large gulp that made me shiver. I was almost sure I wasn’t dreaming.
“It’s me, Animandrill,” the creature said when I opened the front door.
“I know!” I said, and I took a closer look at the product of my imagination. The animal had the body of a monkey, the beak of a bird, the ears of a rabbit, and the tail of a kangaroo. Its belly could glow like the lower abdomen of a firefly. I was five when I met Animandrill for the first time; but that was twelve years ago.
“How long has it been since we last met?” I asked.
“Six years, five months, three days, and seven hours.”
Clearly, Animandrill had been keeping count.
“That must have been right before we moved here,” I said.
“Actually, right after you moved,” Animandrill answered, “but you immediately made friends in your new school. You no longer needed me.”
Animandrill was right. There was a time when I was happy here. I forgot all about him once I had real friends to play with.
I suddenly felt guilty about ignoring him for so long, but I didn’t want that to show.
I pretended to be tough: “To what do I owe the honor of your visit after such a long time?”
“I’m here for two reasons, but the most important one is to ask you how you feel.”
That was a question I hadn’t expected. It threw me off balance. I wasn't sure what to say.
“I… I feel OK, I guess.”
“Don’t be afraid to tell me how you really feel,” Animandrill assured me. “I won’t tell anyone. I couldn’t, even if I wanted to. I only exist for you.”
I couldn’t remember when I last had to suppress a laugh.
“You’re still as funny as I remember,” I said.
What did I have to lose? Animandrill, if he really existed, had never betrayed me before. And if he didn’t exist, well… than it wouldn’t hurt telling him the truth, would it?
“I’m being bullied at school,” I said. “It started as a prank by one of my former friends, but I didn’t respond well to it.”
“Maybe it was a bad prank,” Animandrill said.
“Everyone else in school thought it was the best of pranks,” I admitted. “They said I overreacted, and then I made it worse by having a fit.”
“It escalated.”
“I felt betrayed. Now nobody wants to be my friend anymore.”
“You felt hurt, and no one understood your pain.”
“That’s it,” I said, “but I never managed to put it in words.”
“That’s OK. You shouldn’t worry about that. Words come easier if you can talk to someone you can trust.”
I nodded. What a relief to finally be able to tell someone how I felt without having to explain why I felt that way.
“That’s my answer to your question about how I feel,” I said. “What's the other reason why you’re here?”
“I’m here to save my own life.”
“Save your own life? How so?”
“In your darkest thoughts, you’re creating an organism of a new species. Once it’s completed, it will be as real as I am, but it won’t be your friend. It will be a monster, and it will devour everyone in your life who is kind to you; only your demons will remain.”
“But that’s terrible!”
“It is,” Animandrill sighed. “Especially since I will be its first victim.”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know my dark thoughts could do that.”
“Fortunately, it’s not too late,” my old imaginary friend convinced me. “I’m here to help; you can reverse the process.”
“Please do tell me how.”
“Just let me back into your life for a while,” Animandrill said. “It will be like in the old days. I’ll stay with you as long as needed, not a day longer.”
 
At first, it felt awkward. I questioned my sanity more than once when Animandrill went from class room to class room with me, making fun of teachers, letting me in on gossip that was going on around me, helping me how to defend myself in a smart and witty way. Little by little the embryonic monster that had been growing inside me, shriveled until there was nothing left.
After a couple of weeks, I no longer understood why I had been so unhappy with my life. When I told Animandrill how I felt, he smiled.
“I’ll let you in on a secret,” he said. “Have you noticed how Peyton is looking at you when you’re talking?”
I hadn’t. Not because I didn’t want to look back at her, but because I didn’t dare to.
“I think she wants you to ask her out on a date,” he confided me.
“Are you sure?” I asked.
The next weekend I took Peyton and Animandrill to the movies.
Halfway through the movie, Peyton grabbed my hand and leaned towards me. We shared our first kiss and missed the rest of the movie. When the lights went back on, Animandrill was gone.
I haven’t seen him ever since, except maybe in the corner of my eye, the times he wasn't fast enough to hide himself while watching over me.",How Animandrill saved his life… and mine too
,Kids,"The trail had mist ubiquitously. The soggy midnight was just as much murky as it was drab, but that didn’t hold me. It never would. Mama escaped me just last week and now I’m on my own. Im just a baby, 7 years old. My sister repeated it every day when Mama squawked at me. She’d go right into Mama’s face and state, “jeez Louise, Mama! She’s just a baby, you know!” Mama would become fired up. One night mama just left, leaving me and my sister. My sister took off too the next morning. I knew I couldn’t continue all by myself. In the timbers, I’d surely get eaten by a bear. So I followed on the same trail. Maybe I’d find mama or my sister.
I’m not sure how I ended up in the woods all by myself. I think sister and I went to get some berries from the woods after mama left. She told me to go, but I didn't take notice of it. I loved the woods. Everything about it. Then she left without me, I reckon. I didn't care; I stayed there for as long as I wanted. I knew the way back... so I thought. It took me a week to find my way back, and when I did, nobody was there. Another week later I took off, with a few pieces of meat and water to carry in my mouth.
But Here I Am, talking about my journey, when so many people have it poorer. Some children are awfully small, they don’t know how to walk! 
I spoke to some friends on the streets, on the way of my journey. They have it odd. They don’t have a home, but they have caring parents. I’d rather that. 
I don’t know a portion about time, but I’ve overheard folks chat about it tons of times. According to them, I’m pretty positive it’s been a few hours? Back where my papa lives we didn’t care about no day or night. We played all the time. Papa tells us stories of when he was an infant, when he had this person who would race with him. And they would play with balls together. I don’t know about mama; she doesn’t go for her prior days; I judge she thrived on the hard concrete sidewalks with just nana. 
We once encountered a ball lying around and it made papa happy. it reminded him of his partner who had long legs. 
The sun is growing, so I peer in astonishment at it. The whirling of blues and periwinkles and pinks make me happy, yet bitter, remembering the days mama, papa, sister and I used to follow it in the dawn. I whimper and weep, urging that I find papa or sister. As I think of these remembrances I die down, and suddenly Im snoring, with drool dripping down my face. 
I wake up to see the beautiful golden sun shining brighter than I’ve seen before. The smell is distinct, fresher than I’ve known it to be. Looking around, I notice the flowers are growing higher than they normally do in our forests. Birds are chirping, bees are buzzing, deers are dancing, and- wow look at that! What is it? 
I can’t identify it… a cat? A fox? Owl? squirrel? gazelle? Wait, this animal looked familiar… Mama warned me about this one. The name was something like Lynx; I believe. Mama only said to stay away, but my sister told me more later that night. 
“Little sister,” she said “I know you can’t always trust Ma, but she right about dis thing. It can rip you into pieces, that creature can. It’s nasty, like a giant cat” 
My hazel-coloured eyes widened 2x the size they normally were. My golden-coloured hair thinned out for about a nanosecond, making me shiver, not from the coldness of me being uncovered, but from being scared. 
The Lynx slowly started creeping up on me from behind bushes. I’m superb at sniffing things out, so I know when the Lynx will pounce. But I have little time to think. I take off, running faster than I thought I was capable of. My hairy feet race on the hard rocks of cement. Gasping for air, I take heavy breaths, then starting running even faster. I can feel my ear flapping behind me, the wind increases pushing me the other way, but I won’t stop. Unless it’s meant that I do. The wind is too hard; I stumble down the inclined hard, cement, hill and land right where the Lynx is. I either have two options; to play dead or to run. I don't have time to think I stay there with my eyes open, staring right at the lynx. The lynx has a demon's grin on her face as she inches closer to hurt me. 
I have to go; I have to go; I have to go 
My body isn't listening to my mind, it's not getting up. Right now I could die, I have to think fast. I jump to my feet, and race in the opposite direction of the Lynx and wonderful forest. I breathe heavily again, but it will not stop me this time. The wind is gone now, so I Can speed up. The lynx isn't far behind. Im not sure what she wants from me, but she's not getting anything. I quickly turn the corner so fast she doesn’t know where I went. Now im hiding in a garbage bin.. she won't see me there, right? 
This old man in an enormous truck comes up to the bin. If im not dead by the lynx surely this man will kill me. Ive heard all kinds of ghastly things about people like him. 
His monstrous truck scoops up the bin im in and dumps it into a dark, big, space. Before anything else, I notice the smell. It's terrible... yet it smells like food so I don't mind. Im starved and if I don't eat soon I don't know what’ll happen. Hour after hour an extra load of food dumps on my head, making it smell even worse, but in every tin there's at least one yummy thing to eat. So I stuff my teeny arms with food, hoping each time I Can try to escape... yet I never do. 
__________________________________________
It's dark now, the stars have come out, but not as many as I’m used to. The moon seems small and far away from here. The guy in the truck has taken a break, so if there's any time to escape it would be now. There's a small ladder on the side of the truck. With three turkey sandwiches in my arms and one in my mouth and slowly climb the ladder. Foot by foot, step by step, climb by climb... and then im there! I wasn't expecting to drop from so high, but I’ve only gotten a few scratches by the end of all of this. 
I walk around with all of my sandwiches until I find a small, old, broken bench to sit on. I plop down and before I know it im drooling again. 
“Mom, look! It's a puppy!” is what I wake up to hearing. I let out a small yawn, stretch, then look around for the puppy and girl that disturbed my sleep. 
“Oh, it looks like a golden retriever, doesn’t it?” the mom exclaims 
“Can we keep it? Please, please, pleaseee?” the girl cries with a puppy-eyed look on her face. That was fitting.
“How about we take the puppy to the vet, then go to McDonalds for lunch, sounds like a plan?” 
Before I know it im scooped up by the little girl. “What should I name you, little guy?” she quietly asks 
“You better decide quick, jules, or im letting billy choose”
“NOT BILLY” jules yells, she calms down a few seconds later 
“What about... daisy” she softly whispers 
Daisy, huh? I put my paws on her face and lick her with joy 
“Daisy it is” ",Daisys adventure
,Kids,"               I bet every kid in the world, at some time I’m sure, has wanted a pet. I know I did. I kept asking my mom, and asking, “Mom, please can we get a puppy, please, please, please.” I figure, however, that everyone has endured the pains of disappointment, truly upset because some expectation, some hoping for, was not gratified. When we have our heart set on something, hearing ‘no’ is crushing. That’s why I’m happy to say, I got a new puppy today. I’m so excited! She used the time to discover my preferences.
               My mom surprised me for my thirteenth birthday; today, May 13
. Mom and Dad have been saying ‘no’ for so long now that I was really doubting it would happen. But it did! His name is “Bodhi” and he’s a Border Collie, sheep-dog, just as requested. He is so cute, especially with his rusty-brown and white patches, or his ‘markings’ as breeders call them; two patches of brown around his eyes and white on his nose in between and all about different patches of the two colors. His eyes, when we looked at each other, look like a playful-dizziness. Quite hilarious to see. In any case, My mom and dad surprised me and all the disappointment felt before disappeared today. “Thanks Mom. Thanks Dad. I love you!”
               On top of that, Bodhi has already taken me on a very magical journey; out, just past the field and over the swinging bridge that leads to the river’s edge. We left right after breakfast, this morning. Me and Bodhi, we stopped in the pasture for a few to paly around before going the river and we reached the it mid-morning, after playing, and as the sun started to reach high-above us. I loved the start of this day, and it amounted to a magical trip; although, I’d like to keep it between Bodhi and myself, so I’m writing it down instead of telling anyone-- 
               It was early this morning when my mom and dad woke me up, surprising me with a puppy. We had been discussing it for weeks and the same answer every time, “No Sabrina, we’re not getting a pet” but now I know why; and, I got the exact puppy I wanted, which was a “Queensland-healer” brown and white instead of black and white, of which I kept saying when the topic would come up.  This was the best day ever! First, I was roused, awakened by the wet feel from three puppy-licks, and to the ‘happy-birthday’ song my parents were singing to me. It was all worth the wait, I quickly gave in, and Bodhi is the best thing I ever could have dreamed for. He’s my best friend! And, my mom and dad are so cool. 
               From the moment I woke up, it felt like Bodhi and I attached and bonded immediately, from the moment our eyes connected and the fog lifted from my sleepiness. Nevertheless, getting back to the day. So, Bodhi and I go to the river, after breakfast and after stopping to play in the fields for a few, after running across the bridge and down the path, and we relaxed-in by the bank near a big shady tree. I leaned up against the trunk of it, pulled my book out from my pouch, and while I was reading, Bodhi fell asleep with his head and paws on my lap, laying in between my legs. It was a sunny but cloudy day; I call these days, “fluffy-days”. In any case, I read aloud for Bodhi, just because it felt like he liked it. He laid with content, gratified, and I presumed it was from the sound of me reading, but it was probably from playing in the fields before coming here. We sat in an airy-spot with the clouds drifting-by. 
               As he fell asleep and I got further into the reading, it was like the clouds took over and it felt like Bodhi and I were floating above the world, together. His fluffy-fur, the fluffy-clouds, and my book, “Puff the Magic Dragon” (song released 1963; Artist: Peter, Paul, Mary). The place we were in started to drift with the day, light clouds seem to carry us to some off-distant place, and Bodhi and I took an awfully different ride together. Not one I’ve ever experienced, I can tell you! I can’t tell you yet, whether it was real or just a dream? No matter, it was the best dream ever; if, in fact, it was just a dream. The place we drifted to must not have been too-far away because in what felt like less than a minute, the cloud Bodhi and I were on dissipated and we were left standing on a tall-mountaintop with the clouds all around us.
               The clouds were not solid or firm, and they continued to float about; around us, from top to the bottom and even through us, as we looked-out at a panoramic view of blue-water-sea, all-encompassing of this spot or island upon which Bodhi and I now stood, atop of the largest mountain on the island. This was such a beautiful sight to see; such a wonderful, perfect birthday! Bodhi started tugging my pant-leg and pulling me so as to go with him; I obliged, and he guided us to a trail which lead down the mountain and into, what looked like, a small village with one big tent, like a circus-tent, and a bunch of bungalows all around it. We took out time exploring as we went down the hill but this place was mysterious, to say the least. The ambiance was pleasure and joy, but confusion and wonder also was mixed into the feelings. 
               When we reached the town, no one was around, at all. Bodhi barked at me and directed us to the big tent we saw from the mountain. The trail went around and around the mountain, and as we were coming down it, I hadn’t really noticed just how small the parish, or the tent, actually was; I mean, it couldn’t have been bigger than our school auditorium, which can only hold 785 kids at one time. I held Bodhi back for a minute when we got there because I wanted to take a peek first. You know, to see what we in for. Bodhi, however, had other plans and he rushed into the tent without any notice. By more instinctive nature, more than anything I would presume, I rushed in after him. 
               What was inside the tent was shocking; almost, unbelievable. It was like every kid who had ever been disappointed at one time in their life or another, hurt or saddened by one thing and another, was in that tent. Every sad moment I had ever had was represented in a different kid; each one sharing their story, as Bodhi and I went and visited each one of them during the day. Each kid wanted this or that, was sad because this happened or that happened, but after talking and Bodhi jumping and playing, each kid would regain happiness and get up and go out to play about the village. There were literally hundreds of children, all younger than myself and we got to make each one of them joyfully-happy that day; and, their problems were no longer problems after Bodhi and I got past them in the tent. 
               Soon, all the kids who were in the tent, with symptoms like they were sick or something, after we came, were now out and about playing. Bodhi and I went to join them and we all shared with games and laughter that whole entire day. We played hopscotch, tether ball, marbles, and Jacks. It seemed time was standing still for oh so very long during this wonderful day. And Bodhi; well, I couldn’t have gotten anything more precious than what I got this thirteenth birthday of mine. A day I will never forget and always cherish. Bodhi made all the difference in the world; not only for me, but all those other hundreds of sad kids. I remember, just before we left the town, there was not one upset kid and that having such a feeling and knowing this was an awesome experience! I don’t know, at least with Bodhi around, how I could ever be sad or get disappointed again. 
               Before I knew it, Bodhi as tugging at my clothes again. Only this time, it was him pulling at my shoulder and arm sleeve. I woke up under the tree again, by the river bank. There was my boy, Bodhi, just nipping and growling and pulling at me; almost, it seemed, with a smile on his snout? His eyes met mine, like in the morning, and I sat up to ruffle him up a bit and play for a few before leaving for home. It must have been a while at the island of “Honali” because the sun was now starting to lower to the level of the horizon. I put my things back in the pouch and me and Bodhi headed back towards home. I couldn’t help but feeling pride in how much joy my pet brought to all those kids; Bodhi, my new best friend, was a hero that day and I was proud of our trip to the island. Something I never forgot to this day, 23 years later.
               Bodhi has since passed-on and I hope to see him again someday; but, it will never go unrecognized how much support this one pet brought to me at that time in my life. I have my own daughter now and her father and I just got her a pet; it’s only a fish, but she’s only 5 years old, too. We know we will get her a puppy someday, that’s just how this works, but we are waiting so she can decide in time what pet suits her the best; like, the way Bodhi had done for me from the time I was 13 until I reached 26, ten years ago. He was my sole best friend for all that time. Then Jack and I met, had little Jessica, and now after those ten years in between, I too am ready for another friend like the one I had in Bodhi. 
               Pets mean more than anything else sometimes; especially, for a child who is really looking to have a pet. A dog, a cat, or a fish, it doesn’t matter because pets open passages to the gift of life for a child. At least, one did for me; Bodhi, my long lost companion, who I will never forget, made so many kids in one day happier than they will ever forget. This little bit of encouragement is sometimes all a child may need. From there, the world is an imaginable, fun place for everyone to enjoy. Just remember to take one thing from my story, if nothing else; a pet can mean the world of difference for a child’s world-view, offering compassion and love. So, don’t neglect the connections that are freely offered through a pet. Besides, they remain in your life forever! (1870) TLD 5-10-2020",Bodhi's My Best Friend!

	“Knock, knock.”
	That certainly wasn’t intended for me.
	“Knock, knock.”
	I lowered my newspaper and saw a man sitting in the formerly empty seat at my table. An unusual thing to do in a not-so-crowded Starbucks. The man grinned as he stared at me. The slight wrinkles on the corners of his mouth and the hint of grey in his unkempt brown hair told me this guy was middle age.
	“Excuse me?” I asked. 
	“Knock, knock,” he repeated a third time.
	“Do I know you?”
	“Knock, knock.”
	If I were a violent man, I’d have punched him by now. It took me a moment, but I realized what he was doing. “A joke?”
	“Knock, knock,” he chirped with renewed enthusiasm. 
	“I don’t have time for-” I stopped myself and sighed. I’d been on this planet long enough to know that in a case like this, it was easier to give in than to argue. “Fine. Who’s there?”
	“Orange.”
	“Orange who?”
	“Orange you glad I decided to sit next to you.”
	Maybe I would punch him. 
	Seeing my blank face, he tried to explain further: “Orange... Aren’t? Aren’t you glad I decided to sit next to you.”
	“I don’t get it.”
	“But you get me,” he beamed.
	“That I certainly do not.” I had no clue why a man his age would sit at an occupied table and tell an older man a stupid joke.
	“I mean to talk to,” he explained. “You get to talk to me.”
	“Why would I want to talk to you?” I didn’t mean to sound offended, but I did.
	“Never hurts to make new friends.”
	“I didn’t come here to make new friends,” I told him. “I came here to get a break from my family.”
	I hated betraying them to a stranger. As much as I loved my wife and children, our home life was constant chaos. The kid’s activities schedules were more complicated than calculus. My wife and I constantly fell behind in house maintenance and laundry. And it all seemed amplified on the weeks I had to work overtime.
	One night my wife and I agreed we were going to snap if we didn’t give ourselves a little “me” time. So once a week she covered for me while I skipped out the Starbucks with the newspaper or a book. And once a week I manned our rocky ship while she saw a movie. 
	So the last thing I wanted to do during my free time was deal with this adult child.
	“Things happen when you least expect it,” he said. 
	“That’s nice,” I pacified him and went back to reading my paper.
	“But it’s happening now,” he said excitedly. “With me.”
	“I’m sorry,” I spoke without lowering the paper. “I’m not interested in what you’re selling.”
	“I’m not selling anything.”
	“That was my polite way of saying: Go away.”
	He didn’t.“We could be best pals.”
	“At my age, I don’t need best pals. I’ve got my family.”
	“But you had to get away from them.”
	“For some alone time.”
	“You don’t have to be alone. I’m here.”
	I flipped down my paper and shouted at him: “I don’t want you here.”
	“OK,” he said nonplussed. He continue to stare at me, expressionlessly. I preferred his creepy grin.
	I calmly told him: “I want you to leave.”
	“You don’t mean that.”
	“What else could I-” I stopped myself as I was shouting again. This man wasn’t worth giving myself a heart attack.
	“You need a best friend.”
	“My wife’s my best friend.”
	“A real best friend. I can be that. I’ll bring you flowers and candy.”
	I laughed. “Are you looking to be my best friend or my boyfriend?”
	“I’ll bring you whatever you like. Potato chips and porn mags?”
	Ignoring the strangeness of that last suggestion, I decided this man needed parental guidance. So I turned on the “Father Knows Best” voice I used when speaking to my children. “Listen, there’s lots of places you can go to make new friends. But wandering up to strangers in coffee shops is not the way to do it.”
	“Why not?” he asked like one of my kids.
	“It’s just… strange.”
	“Oh.”
	Out of pity for this lost soul, I suggested: “How about joining a book club, or a church group, or one of those foodie meet-ups?”
	“I don’t read, believe or eat.”
	I wanted to scream: “You have to eat.” But managed to say it in a rational tone.
	“I do, but none of that fancy stuff. I’d try it if you’d like me to.”
	“I don’t want you to do anything for me.”
	“Spoken like a true friend.”
	“I’m not your friend!” This time I did scream, attracting the attention of the other patrons. 
	“I know it’s tough for men to show their emotions.”
	I thought I was. 
	“We’ll learn how to get along together,” he continued. “Like a buddy cop film. Do you like movies? We should go sometime.”
	“I’m not going anywhere with you.”
	“More of a stay at home kind of guy, huh?”
	There was no stopping this guy.“There’s something seriously wrong with you.”
	I stood to leave.
	He jumped up excitedly. “Where’re we going next?”
	“I’m going to the bathroom.”
	“I have to draw the line of our friendship somewhere,” he laughed.
	Finally, some good luck. “Happy to hear that. I’ll be right back.”
	I grabbed my newspaper.
	“You can leave that,” he said.
	“I need to read something. If you know what I mean?”
	“I prefer comic books.”
	“You’ll have to let me borrow some sometime.”
	“I will!” he exclaimed.
	“I’ll be right back.”
	“I’ll be right here.”
	He watched as I walked down the hall to the bathroom. He didn’t know there was an exit back there. I practically ran out the door and toward my car.
	While exiting, I drove past the Starbucks and looked into the window. The strange little man sat waiting for my return. 
	I stopped, much to the dismay of the cars behind me. 
	How long before her realized I wasn’t coming back?
	 Minutes passed. Angry cars drove around me. Profanity was spewed.
	He didn’t bulge. ",BFF
,Kids,"I remember the first time I met Alicia, I was working late at my uncle’s diner. It was the perfect little place for, cars to come in and have a bite. The night’s cool breeze blew through the empty diner, while I was scrubbing down the dirty tables with a fresh rag. I turned up the radio to 50 and had a little jam session while I did my task. I was closing up tonight and if my uncle Fred saw even a little speck of jam on the counter I knew he would flip. I kept the door open a little just so I didn’t feel so lonely. At that time I was, so awfully lonely. For some reason I never thought that from an onlooker a small 18 year old waitress, would be the perfect prey. I returned the now dirty rag to the sink and went to the front to organize the pastry tins, my back facing the door. I was so immersed in my task that I didn’t hear the man approaching the door, I didn’t hear his heavy boots stomping its way over or feel his menacing gaze through the big windows. When he opened the door, I couldn’t even hear the tiny jingle from the bell. But when I suddenly became aware of my surroundings it all happened so fast. The hairs on my back stood up. I turned around to the sight of a .38 Caliber pointed directly at my head. My heart fell to the floor. What does it even feel like to stare in to the eyes of death? I couldn’t tell you, in that moment I blacked out. However behind the brown mask I remember seeing those, painfully bleak eyes. He was 2 times bigger than me, granted I was only 5 foot 1 and held the gun with no fear. He told me to give him all the money in the cashier. I hesitated to move, worried that any sudden move would result in my brain being splat all over the counter. He brought the gun closer to my head and said: “Do you want to die… DO YOU WANT TO DIE?” He shook with pure anger. I walked to the register and emptied it all out, I didn’t leave a penny unaccounted for. When I handed it to him, he yelled again: “PUT YOU’RE HANDS ON YOU’RE HEAD AND TURN AROUND”. I did. Shaken to my very core. I remember thinking: ‘Whatever happens in these final moments is alright, death is alright’. I held my breath and heard him cock his gun. My heart beat out of my chest, and gasped for tiny little breaths of air. My body was numb, ice cold my head was empty. Then I heard a shot. 
For a second the world went black… a second later I heard a loud thud on the floor. It… It wasn’t me. My body was still tense, the air around me was still cold yet I wasn’t dead but it felt like I was still about to be. Then I heard a voice:
“Holy F***k”
It was a woman’s. 
“Turn around” she said
I let out a slow, shaky breath before slowly turning around and my hands down. At the door was a woman, probably early twenties. She had short ginger hair, a tall slim physic and the largest gun I had ever seen. Her clothes were a little old and worn out now splattered with little drops of blood, and her face was pale and sunken. After starring at her I finally uttered my first words to her. 
“Where is he” I said quietly
She looked at the floor and smiled. I peered over the counter and there he was. The beast. His body sprawled on the floor, his mouth wide open, his gun on the floor, blood leaking out. 
“Why are you smiling?”I asked worryingly 
“2 years… it took 2 years” she said sighing while putting her gun down on the table and sitting down
“You just—”I started
“I couldn’t see him do it to another person” 
“Another?”
“Yeah” she said, rubbing her face with her hands. I looked behind her to see a small black SUV, I assumed that they must have been partners. 
“Um” I said, looking back at her
“Yeah” she said looking at me
“That um, god… um”
“Crazy”
“You just shot him” I said looking down at him
“I just shot him”
“...just shot him”
“Yeah”
We paused for a second.
“I’m Alicia”
I looked up at her. Was she crazy? Introducing herself after she just killed someone? Do I want to talk to a murderer?
“I’m Vienna”
“Like the sausage?” She asked
“What… um… no… but I do get that a lot” I said easing up 
“Interesting” she said looking back down at the body. I knew that she was terrified. 
“So what do we—“ we both started
We looked up at each other. 
“Jinx?” She said slowly, with a smile
“Yeah um… what do we do now?” I said shaking my head
“Police?”
“Yeah’ I said, I remember about to move before asking her another question
“How do I know you won’t shoot me” I asked tensing up again. She let out a little giggle. 
“Don’t worry” she said as she got up and let and gun on the counter. “C’mon don’t be worried, I wouldn’t want to end up behind bars after just being freed”
“Okay” I said as I slowly reached for the phone. 
“9-1-1 what’s you’re emergency?”
———————-
Alicia and I sat there for a couple of minutes waiting for the police to arrive. This is when I feel we really got to know each other. We really began to understand each other. Strange way to make a friend, let alone a best friend—I know. She told me bits and parts of her life and I told her some of mine. When we heard the siren, she made me promise her to visit her in jail. I nodded, thinking ‘I owe it to her, I doubt she has anyone’. She was cuffed and taken to jail. But in-between court meetings etc, we had our moments to converse. Let me tell you I have never met anyone so full of life. An abusive relationship with a sketchy guy led her here. For someone who had their life taken away for 2 years it was as if she was any normal human. I actually remember being so nervous in court but her smile just made me feel so much better. It was strange but so comforting. She was sentenced to 5 years, for possession of drugs, manslaughter etc. So yes, she was indeed a criminal. Yet every time I came to visit her, she was nothing but smiles. I probably should have stopped talking to her, but there was something about her that drew me in. 
“So hows it going” I said, to her behind the glass screen
“Not bad, not bad. Susan finally shut up after I gave her some of my lunch so that good” 
I smiled. A brief pause. “Whats wrong”
“Alicia, I still feel…so guilty” I sighed putting my hand on my head
“Don’t, I chose to step in. C’mon girl” she said as she put her hand on the glass
“No I just—“
“Maybe what I am about to say will make you feel better”
“What”
“What?” she said mockingly 
“No seriously what” I laughed
Her face suddenly got so serious. She bit her lip, staring at the guard and back at me. Her eyes locked with mine, they looked concentrated but not cold more worried. She opened her mouth and said
“Bullock and Gimes intersection, name under Taylor Simone, pin 2546. Go to teller Mike Hillbury.”
My eyes widened
“Are you asking me to take—“ I whispered
“Yes, you don’t need a card. He knows who you are”
“You want me to take the—“
“Uhhh buh buh buh buh” she said eyeing the guard, she flashed the suspicious guard a fake smile.
I just stared at her. Truly in that moment I was confused. What was she asking me? Why was she asking me? The room got a little colder, a little smaller. I looked at the other people in their stalls, I wondered if they were also being asked to do something illegal. 
“Can you do that?” She asked smiling hopefully 
“This is from—-“ I leaned in closer “The gang money?”
She giggled
“Can you not call it that, you sound so juvenile” she laughed. I sighed. “Hey, it will be alright ok?”
“How much?”I mumbled
“You know what I’m craving?”
“What?”
“Oreos”
“What”
“I could eat like, 7 oreos”
“Alicia what are you—“
“SEVEN oreos”
“Seven… what… huh? Wait… ohhhh” I nodded
“Maybe I could get so fat… They would let me out of here” she said slowly, eyeing the guard again
“Ok?” I said. Another pause
“2546”
“Ok… ok… I got it”
“I miss you”
“See you” I said, before hanging up the phone and getting the hell out of there. 
I walked to my car, with such a nasty shiver down my spine. Nasty. I was about to become a criminal. I was about to become a criminal. 
2 days later I found myself outside the bank. I stared at the glass doors. I made sure to wear something super lokey, black leggings and a black sweatshirt. Not memorable, nothing to look at. 
After I walked in and asked they led me to a small man with his hair was slicked back and a suit nicely pressed.
“Hello... Taylor?” he said calmly
“Hello… Mike”
“Nice to see you again, how may I help you” he said. I couldn’t believe it, he was a criminal too! He was in the gang thing, robbery drug thing. Someone from the bank!
“I need um… seven oreos” I said hesitantly. Giving a slight smile
“Sorry? I don’t know what that means” He questioned.
“Seven oreos, um” I said shakely, I was dripping cold sweat. Oh man, I remember being so worried, I almost pissed my pants
“Taylor, what does that mean”
“… think about it” I said very slowly
His puzzled face turned clear
“2-5” he said quietly he said leaning in. I tensed up again
“4…6” I said slowly. He nodded and walked out of the office. I let out a huge breath, thinking that this nightmare was almost over. He walked back in and handed me a beige envelope. I remember not even looking back up, I just stuffed the money in my purse and scrammed.
It all made no sense. Who is she… just… ugh… man. I was so new to this at the time. I honestly didn’t even know the full case. All I knew is that Alicia needed this. 
I got in my car and sped the heck home. I didn’t even remember how I got to my front step, when I did I put a envelope under my dresser. I stared at myself in the mirror for a good 10 minutes. At the time I was in a 1 bedroom apartment. My uncle used to send me money and thats how I would pay for the majority of it. My parents died when I was 2 years old so leaving my one sole guardian was hard but necessary. I just didn’t want to be there anymore. 
The following week, I went to visit her again. 
“Heyyyy” she said 
“Hey”
“Whats wrong? C’mon that wasn’t that bad”
“Whatever, it really freaked me out ok”
“Are you mad?”
“Kind of”
“I’m sorry ok”
“Fine whatever”
“Seriously, are you ok” she said touching the glass
“Yah yah” I said rolling my eyes
“I still need you to do one more thing
“What”
“Give the money to Gary”
“Your lawyer?”
“He’ll know what to do”
“Seriously?”
“Yes” she said nodding her head. Another pause. “If you don’t feel comfortable thats fine”
“No its whatever, just don’t get me involved in this anymore”
“Promise”
“I’m serious ok, I’m risking it all”
“Promise” she said smiling. I noticed her hand was still on the glass. 
I made sure to remember that when I pulled up to Gary’s house, I almost had a panic attack. It was quite a nice house actually, I never came up there before that time so I worried I might have knocked at the wrong house. But sure enough there he was granted in his robe and drawers but there he was. He looked the same as he did a year before. 
“Hello Vienna” he said, his disgruntled face looked at me up and down.
“Hello Gary, I am here on behalf of Alicia” I said, I tried to seem confident but I remember having a terrible tremble in my voice
“Alright…” he said looking behind me. An awkward silence passed. I began to pull the envelope out. I remember his reaction all too well. He quickly pulled me inside and locked the doors and tightened his robe
“Oh my god” I said, my eyes were bulging out of my head
“What are you doing?!”
“I don’t know she she she said give you the thing and you would”
“No no no, people could see you. Give it to me” he said sighing, he grabbed the money out of my hand and counted. “Good leave”
“Sorry?”
“Leave now”
“You don’t want them to find out about you”
“The gang?”
He looked at me puzzled
“What gang”
“The gang she’s in… isn’t she in a gang. Thats what was said”
He gave a little chuckle
“Oh man, rookie”
“So theres no gang?”
“Bye bye” he said as he pushed me out the door. I stood out there, completely stunned. I was in this web of confusion, hurt and fear. 
I didn’t come to visit her for a while. It was weird actually, we had been pretty good friends since the moment she saved my life and in some twisted way I missed her. Some weird twisted way. During this time I was so paranoid, I added new locks to my doors, I changed up my hair and even my name. I went a little crazy actually. For months and months I waited for some sign that she was ok. Even if I didn’t want to see her. 
One day after a long days work at my sad minimum wage job, I saw her. Outside my apartment. Outside. Of. It. She turned her head and gave me a little smile.
“Heyyy”
“Oh my god”
“Give a hug… actually can I have sip of water first I’m thirsty?”
I led her in and gave her a cup. I know what you’re thinking, why, why would I let a criminal in my home. But in the moment all I saw was… Alicia. 
“So”
“So I know that Gary spilled the beans”
“Yeah”
“Yes, I’m in a crime family”
“WHAT THE F***!!!” I shouted
“Hey hey hey I thought you knew this”
“Not this, I did NOT know this”
“Dammit Gary”
“You’re You’re”
“Yes, Alicia Newuvosi member of the Newuvosi crime family”
“But what about”
“He was my brother, not my boyfriend”
“WTF he was but in court you”
“He wanted to go his separate way and somehow talked me in to it”
“Oh my god”
“After 4 years we were almost bankrupt, the family had made sure to cut off all our vendors and clients”
“Oh my god”
“Then he started robbing, houses, small shops you name it. I couldn’t take it anymore” she said looking at the ground
“Oh my god”
“I couldn’t take it” she looked up “I know that this is insane and doesn’t make any sense at all, but you have to believe me… you’re the only real friend I have”
“Ok” I said softly, looking at the ground. I couldn’t collect my thoughts. 
“Mike and Gary are just old friends of my family’s, they cut off ties a little while ago. They always liked me I think” she said giving a light chuckle “Taylor Simone is just a fake name we used to use”
“Ok…” 
A brief moment silence passed. I looked up from the ground. 
“So then what are you doing here” I said finally
“I wanted to thank you, so much. Honestly, I don’t even know how to repay you.”
“Its um—“ I start
“But I dooo” she said in a singsong voice
“What”
“How does some cash sound?”
“So you’re back in the family?” I asked
“More or less, its a work in progress. After my parents died they always looked at me funny, to be honest. Me and my brother never fit in”
""When did they die?""
""They went to the country side and wanted to start a new life with the family, including us. Someone found them and took a hit on them when I was 5""
My heart started to beat faster again. Sweat pooled on my forehead.
“Wait money for me?” I said, quickly changing the subject
“All for you” she smiled as she pulled out an envelope
“Oh my god Alicia”
“Buh buh buh its okay”
“No no I can’t accept it, this is crime money and stuff I can’t be involved in this”
“C’mon”
“Alicia”
“Fine fine”
Silence
“Thanks for visiting” I said getting up
“Thanks for even letting me in” she said also standing up “Tell me if you ever need help”
“How do you know I’m not going to turn you in”
“C’mon we’re friends right?” She said smiling at me 
“Friends” I said before waving and closing the door. 
I stayed there for another 3 months trying to wrap my head around everything before moving back with... Fred. Good ol' Fred. I just had too many unanswered questions.",Guilty
,Kids,"	I’d seen her around but never thought to say anything. Maybe it was a trip to the bathroom where we’d acknowledge each other with a slight nod. Or we’d end up sitting next to each other but find our conversations limited to what we were doing in class that particular day. But something about her threw me off. Maybe it was her positivity about each and every bad situation. And to be honest, I looked up to her. Admired her. God, Eden is one of the top cheerleaders in the squad. And really? She was beautiful, with her stunning green eyes and blond locks. Yet somehow, being the most popular girl in my grade, I couldn't bring myself to befriend her. The always alone- hated for no reason- kind of girl. So what? Does popularity mean power? I suck in a sharp breath and throw my bag over my shoulder, and stride into class. 
	“Hey!” I greet her, sliding into the seat next to Eden which obviously takes her by surprise because she blinks in confusion before letting a sweet smile take over her face. 
	“Hi, Bella,” She says, then pauses and asks, “Where’s Stephanie and Rhyme?”
	“Just...thought I’d sit here today!” But seeing Eden’s smile dropped a little I quickly add, “Is that okay?”
	“More than okay.” She exclaims willing the smile to return. “Sooo, how have you been?” Eden asks.
	“Pretty good, I guess. Steph and Ry have been pretty jerky lately so…” I pause and tilt my head, smiling. “I was hoping I could hang out with you!” She gasps and sucks in every millimeter of air in the room. I can read her mind: 
	“I’d love that. I’d really love that.” Eden whispers, closing her eyes. Her huge, genuine smile returns. Eden’s glasses perfectly frame her face, giving her this sexy librarian kind-of-look. She has those eyes that could make guys melt to fudge and work like slaves under her name. 
	“We could, ya know, go shopping after school, meet up with some guys, go to the movies?” I suggest waving my hands in the air.
	“Sure, sounds fun!” She says, turning in response to having sensed someone behind her. Steph and Ry. 
	“NO, NO, and NO! Don’t you dare even try to accept her invitation out of pity for your sad, friendless life! And if you think you can get away with stealing OUR friend, you are underestimating the power beneath this hand!” Yells Stephanie, motioning to her fist.
	“C’mon Steph. Ry. Tone it down a little. And don’t talk to her that way!” I immediately say, coming to her defense. Eden slaps her hand on the table, standing up and literally explodes. She is screaming so loud, the whole class freezes and stares. Even Steph and Ry don’t move for a minute. Mr. Tygan rushes over there, eyes wide, and attempts to calm the situation. All three of them are escorted to the office as soon as Mr. Tgyan gets an apology out of them for having an “obnoxious outburst” in class. The entire class sits there, frozen for a second but then as if on cue, they begin to chat wildly. I cross the room and plop next to Elias. 
	“It’s been a while. Can’t believe you stood up to Stephanie and Rhyme like that.” The corner of his mouth lifts and hints at a smile. We begin to laugh so hard until everyone is staring intensely in our direction. 
	“Yea I know!” I can’t stop smiling.“Hey, you should come to the mall after school with us.”
	“Who’s us? Steph and Ry?” He teases.
	“God, no. Me and Eden. Bring the others.” 
	“Eden? I’ll be there.” He says so confidently that it makes me burst in fits of laughter once more. 
	“God, Elias. You're such a slut.” I say through convulsions that have sent me into hysterics. And then because I can’t resist, I add, “I knew it all along. See you there.” I exit class but hear the barely audible,
I smile, not turning back once. As soon as I enter the office, I see Eden who is frantically waving me over. 
	“Thank GOD you came. My Dad has to pick me up.” She says with a tired look. “But he will drop me off at the mall.” 
	“Okay well, I’m gonna head. See you there!” I bend down giving her a quick hug and fling my hair over my shoulder, exiting the school. I approach my car but can’t help feeling that I’ve done something right. As I drive, A thousand thoughts flood my mind, 
My thoughts are interrupted as I pull up to the mall. I debate turning around. 
Closing my eyes, I suck in a  deep breath. I force myself inside to the bench we had agreed on meeting at. When she doesn’t come and I see Elias instead I can’t decide whether I’m happy.  
	“Aww, what’s wrong? Didn’t show up?” I Smile, turn, and there she is. Walking towards me, wearing her winning smile, carrying a bag. My head is spinning with relief so great, I can’t stop myself from running and launching myself into her arms. 
	“Whoa!” She says tumbling backward before hugging me back with the same amount of delight. “Who’d you bring with you?” She says, motioning towards Elias and his crew.
	“Eden, this is my good childhood friend, Elias. These are his friends!” I announce. We walk to one of the mall's restaurants. I’m not quite sure what to say at first but I end up telling her all about Stephanie and Rhyme. My friends, family, life, everything. From my favorite color to toilet paper. The guys have been gone for a while now, and we have been sitting in the restaurant for six hours. We have been chatting like we’ve known each other for our whole lives. I have found my place! I have stumbled upon an abrupt realization that this is what true friendship is all about.",Friendship Comes First
,Kids,,Hole in the Sky
,"Adventure, Fantasy, Kids","It was a sunny afternoon in Thellarion, warming up the land from that morning rainstorm. White mists rose from the forest and climbed up the hills where they collected back into white puffy clouds atop mountain peaks. A gentle breeze blew and the sky was a deep dark blue, clean and washed. It was an ideal time for an adventure and four friends from nearby villages were already on their way up to where applecherries grew.
“Quite a storm this morning,” said Desmon, a twelve year old human boy. “Hope the hail didn’t smash all the cherries.” 
“It didn’t,” said Nuala, a one-hundred-and-twenty-one year old elvish girl. “My dad says that the applecherry trees generate a magical aura with their canopy, which helps protect them from bad weather. I’m pretty sure that the 
 was smashed, not the 
.” She gave Desmond one of those cheeky looks that made him blush. Nuala was very pretty, with her fair purplish skin, deep green eyes and long silvery hair, that looked like strands made from stars themselves.
“Oh, right,” Desmond said, trying to hide his blush by looking away. “I knew that.”
“What makes them magical?” asked another girl, a five year old orc called Krunch, the tallest of the group. And the most muscular. Her green skin, and black dredd hair made her look much older than she was, but orcs matured very fast. When her tusks start to grow, she’ll never hear the end of it from other race’s boys.
“It’s their roots,” explained Nuala, sounding very confident. “They penetrate deep into the earth, all the way to Gaia, Nature’s Mother. All those who drink from her pool grow magical abilities.”
A scratchy and hearty laugh echoed from the fourth member of the group. Dornolir, the thirty-five year old dwarven boy was soon going to enter puberty, just like the rest of his friends. But unlike the rest of his friends, Dornolir had already grown a handspan long bushy beard under his chin.
“What’s so funny 
” asked Nuala, rolling her eyes.
The dwarf wiped a tear in his eye. “You elves think it’s all about flowers and roots and stuff, but lemme tell ya; I live the nearest to those trees! My da has his mine set up in the foot of the mountains there and I know what makes those cherries magical.”
Nuala puffed and shook her head, making Desmond gawk over the way her pretty hair moved.
“Tell already,” said Krunch, eager to know.
Dornolir chuckled. “You won’t like the taste of ‘em if I do.”
Krunch started to growl, a thing she did every time someone annoyed her. “Spit it out or I punch you!”
The dwarf boy sighed. “Troll poop. Their diet consists of pixies, which makes their poop magical. The trees grew out from that.”
“Well, that’s one good fertilizer then,” said Desmond, grimacing. “Do you think their poo also tastes as heavenly as the applecherries?”
“Oh my god…” Nuala placed a hand at her mouth, pretending she’s sick.
Dornolir laughed loudly again.
“
?”
“Desmond has a point,” said Krunch. “In my tribe, we’re not picky. We eat what we can find. You’d be surprised how much nutrients animals don’t digest.”
Nuala spread her arms out. “Can we 
 change the subject!”
Dornolir chuckled. “Dung is also part of nature, 
 
. Or perhaps elves don’t have to shit?”
Nuala shot an angry look at the dwarf. “Only because I live in the forest, doesn’t mean I 
 everything about it! Besides, we have manners. We are clean and well manicured.”
“What does 
 mean?” demanded Dornolir, suspecting the comment was aimed at his beard.
“Guys, shut up,” said Krunch. “Look.”
“The applecherry!” Desmond pointed.
Their hike through the forest took some time, since the applecheries grew quite deep in the woods, where the slopes of the mountains began to rise steeply. Before them rose a small orchard of wild applecherry trees. These trees were taller than most castle towers and their trunks were so wide that gnomes often carved their homes into them. The bark was thick and often cracked at the bottom, allowing for perfect footholds. 
And the fruit. Delicious, deep red cherries, the size of apples. Their taste was downright heavenly and they even possessed some magical powers of their own. People say that if one ate enough of them, they could grow magic within themselves.
“Last one to the cherries is a smelly goblin!” Nuala shouted and dashed first towards the tree.
“Hey, wait up!” Desmond fell in behind her.
“I’m not a smelly goblin!” shouted Krunch like it was an insult and sprinted on all fours at the tree, easily overtaking the elf and the human.
Dornolin sighed audibly and slowly walked after his friends. He didn’t know how to climb.
Krunch reached the foot of the tree first and jumped on its trunk, getting a firm foothold and then propelled herself up like a squirrel. Her dredd hair waved behind her like a general’s cape and her mouth spread in a competitive grin. Desmond reached the tree a few seconds after her and started climbing, but his foot slipped. The bark was still wet from the rain and before he found a solid foothold, Nuala was already there. She made a show of gracefully walking past Desmond and then 
 
, like it was normal ground!
The human boy gawked again at elven magic, amazed as though he’d seen it for the first time. Nuala bathed in his attention and walked onto the first branch, sitting down on it, legs dangling. She tapped the branch at her side.
“Come on,” she invited him, like some puppy.
And Desmon, like some puppy, climbed after her. 
In the meantime, Krunch was already half up the tree, laughing and shouting, snapping small twigs and leaves as she went. Competition seemed to made her forget all about why they came here.
“What’s the matter, Dornolin,” mocked Nuala from her branch, as the dwarf dragged his feet to the tree. “Can’t climb a tree?”
“Nonsense!” the dwarf barked. “Of course I can! I just don’t see the reason to. I’m a carnivore, I don’t eat stupid fruit!”
Desmond managed to reach Nuala’s branch and he went to pick the first fruit. “Are you sure Dornolin? But you told me the other day that you’re afraid of-”
“Hey!”
Desmond paused, realizing he was about to reveal his friend’s secret. “Um, I mean, the way you climbed our town’s mage tower was quite impressive, yes.”
Dornolin ran a hand down his face. Nuala’s eyes widened and she shouted down at the dwarf.
“I knew it! You can’t climb because you’re afraid of heights! That’s why you talk mean of us elves, you’re jealous of me living on a tree!”
“Ah shove yer breath down yer lungs and choke!” Dornolin barked, face red.
Desmond tried to change their bickering by biting into an applecherry. The sweet taste made him shiver with delight. “Guys, these cherries are 
 good, you should try them.”
“Bah!” came a sound from down below, followed by a barrage of juicy dwarven curses that luckily no one understood but Dornolin himself.
Nuala wore a satisfied smirk on her face. “Would you pick one for me too, Desmond?” She extended her arm expectantly.
“Of course Nuala,” said the human boy and quickly walked the thick branch on a quest to find the perfect fruit.
As Desmond went, suddenly an applecherry fell directly in Nuala’s lap, from up above. Nuala yelped and as she looked up, she saw Krunch coming down the tree towards them.
“Watch it, you 
!”
“Shhh!” 
Nuala shut her mouth. There was a worried expression on the orc’s face.
“What’s wrong?”
“Trolls,” Krunch hushed. “I saw one coming here, from the top of the tree. We must climb higher and hide! Where is Dornolin?”
Nuala’s eyes widened. “He’s down there. But he can’t climb!”
“Here you go, Nuala,” said Desmond, bringing a ripe juicy applecherry, a true masterpiece of a fruit. Nuala smacked his hand away, causing the fruit to fall and splat on the ground.
“A troll is coming,” she hushed. 
Desmond drowned in her beautiful, wide open, deep green eyes, filled with focus and concern. “What?”
Nuala smiled.
“You two are idiots,” said Krunch and turned down to Dornolin, who was still mumbling curses to himself and kicking at the splatted applecherry on the ground. “Pst, hey Dornolin!”
“Yes, yes, I can’t climb because I’m afraid of heights, are you happy now?!”
“Dornolin, you fool, a troll is coming!”
Behind the dwarf, something moved in the trees. Something 
.
Dornolin slowly turned around. “By the beard of Dralin…”
“Climb, you fool! 
!”
A spruce tree cracked loudly and fell to the ground, as a hulking mass of a body made its way over it. It was indeed a troll! Some fifteen feet tall, with arms and legs as thick as most trees, covered in thick yellow-brown skin. Its head was huge, small beady eyes darting around nervously, until locking on the dwarf, who stood there, jaw dropped.
“Dornolin!” shouted Desmond. “You’ve got to climb!”
“The fool is in shock,” said Krunch. She took the applecherry that fell in Nuala’s lap and threw it at the dwarf’s head. It was a direct hit.
“Oy!”
“
!”
Dornolin realized what was happening and launched himself at the tree. He struggled desperately to get a footing, but it was no use. Panic and inexperience with climbing were too much. And the first branch, that his friends were on, was just too high to reach.
“Can’t you use your magic to lift him up?” asked Desmond. “Or perhaps drive the troll away?”
“I don’t know how to lift him!” Nuala expressed, her voice stripped of all snarkiness. “I guess I could throw a fireball at it, but I doubt it would do anything.”
“No,” said Krunch. “You’ll just piss it off more. Come on Dorn, 
!”
“I’m bloody 
!” Dornolin finally got a footing. “Ha-ha! Never underestimate a dwarf!”
Then, he began to fly, feeling weightless all of a sudden. He thought that Nuala must have lifted him with magic somehow, but judging by the expressions on his friends’ faces, that was not it.
“Oh dear.”
The troll picked him up and roared at the rest of his friends, causing them to scramble higher up the tree in fear. Dornolin tried to break free from the giant palm that held him, but he wasn’t even remotely strong enough. The troll, satisfied with his catch, turned and left.
“No, 
!” Desmond shouted desperately from the tree. They could all see the troll slowly lumbering away, and they could hear their friend cursing loudly. At least that meant that he was alive, for now.
“We must go after him!” 
“Yes,” said Krunch. “Before he gets eaten!”
“Hm, do we 
 though?”
Desmond was shocked. “Nuala, he’s our 
! What if the beast took you instead?”
Nuala shook her head. “Yes, you’re right. But how will we get him back?”
“We’ll worry about that later,” said Krunch and jumped to the ground. Her strong orcish legs managed to absorb the impact without breaking her bones. “Come on!”
“Wow, did you see that?” said Desmond, amazed. “She just 
!” It was nearly twenty feet to the ground.
Nuala rolled her eyes. “Big deal. I can do that too.” 
The elf stood up and jumped. Desmond was about to shout, but Nuala was gently gliding through the air until she touched the ground with her bare feet.
“Unbelievable…”
“Get down already, Desmond!” shouted Krunch, who was already on the troll’s trail. In the distance, Dornolin’s screams could still be heard.
Eventually, the three of them followed the troll trail to a huge cave entrance. It was located at the foot of the mountains, where the rocky slopes began to rise steeply. It was wide and tall enough to allow for trolls to enter.
“This must be its lair,” said Krunch, sniffing the air. “There could be more than one inside.”
“Guys, I don’t like this,” said Nuala. “Dornolin’s home isn’t far, perhaps we should get help?”
“The longer we wait, the higher the chance our friend gets eaten,” said Desmond. “Trolls have a big appetite.”
“We go in,” said Krunch and did not linger to argue further.
“Hold my hand, Desmond,” said Nuala and pressed herself against him. Desmon felt a surge of butterflies in his stomach at the touch and fires lighted in his cheeks.
He placed his arm around her. “How will we see anything in there?” 
The cave seemed to go deep inside the mountain, and there were no signs of inner light. “My mother gave me this for my 100th birthday,” said Nuala. She produced a beautifully designed necklace and held it to her mouth. She whispered a few elvish words, which sounded like a song to Desmond’s ears, and the necklace began to glow in a soft blue light, illuminating the darkness a few feet around them.
“Good,” said Krunch. “You guys keep low and keep quiet.”
The three of them went deeper into the cave. They walked in silence for some time, accompanied only by their footsteps and the distant echoing shouts of their kidnaped friend, who was still cursing. They never thought they'd be glad to hear that.
“What do you think the trolls will do to him?” asked Desmond after some time.
“Don’t think about that now,'' said Krunch. “Focus on the rescue.”
“I mean, clearly they would eat him, right?”
“I heard that trolls can’t have babies of their own,” said Nuala. “That’s why they steal other people’s children and raise them as their own. They feed them troll milk until they become big and ugly like them.”
“I’ve heard,” said Desmond, “that they take other people as slaves. Dornolin is a dwarf, perhaps he’ll have to dig for them or clean their cave...”
“You two are fools,” said Krunch. She paused. “Dornolin said that trolls eat pixies, right? Well, it’s only logical that he’ll have to take care of raising pixies for them.”
“That’s not that horrible,” said Nuala. “I always wanted to have a pixie to play with.”
“Shh, look!”
Up ahead, a rainbow of colors seemed to illuminate the cave. The trio proceeded carefully and as they came close enough, they noticed the light was coming from hundreds, if not thousands of caged pixies. Each of them was a tiny creature, no more than a hand tall, and locked inside large glass bottles, many at a time.
 they whispered with their tiny voices.
“Oh, the poor things…” whispered Nuala and squeezed Desmond’s hand firmly.
“We’ve got a bigger problem,” said Krunch and pointed. Up ahead, the cave widened. There were pixie bottles placed all over the cave, in the corners, hanging from the ceiling. And in the middle of the cave, three trolls sat on individual boulders. They were talking lively and 
.
“What the… is that Dornolin?”
“What is he 
?!”
Dornolin stood on the chest of one of the trolls, a sharp blade in hand and encroaching the beast's neck. The trio watched closely as he got a hold of the troll’s beard and then… 
...he cut it!
“Beard trimming is a highly valued profession if you ask my father,” Dornolin explained as he cut the troll’s beard. “It is a long and ancient dwarvish tradition. Said to be a way of paying our respects for the long winter we lived in the Wilderness in the old days.”
The trolls mumbled with interest!
“
,” exclaimed Krunch. “What are you 
?!”
“Oh, hey guys!” the dwarf waved at his friends.
“You’re trimming their beards? We were worried sick that they would eat you!”
“Eat him?” grumbled one of the trolls. “Why would you think that? We don’t eat dwarves, or other races for that matter. Bones hard to swallow and harder to digest.”
“And,” said Dornolin, “they don’t even eat pixies, as I thought. They only use them for light.”
Nuala seemed to ease a little, hearing that.
Krunch frowned. “What 
 they eat, then? Rocks?”
“Close,” said another troll, his voice booming. “Stone golems. They grow in caves and such.”
The trio exchanged looks. “So,” said Krunch, suspiciously. “You’re not evil and hostile creatures?”
Now the three trolls exchanged looks. “We thought,” said one of them, “that 
 are the evil ones. Hunting and killing our people and using our skins as carpets. That’s why we were afraid of simply asking your friend to cut our beards and kidnaped him. Sorry about that.”
“Well, this is awkward,” said Desmond and scratched the back of his head.
The three of them just stood there for about an hour, waiting for Dornolin to finish with the beards. When he was done, the trolls looked much better and more civilized than before. They were so pleased that they paid him with gemstones.
“Can’t eat the hearts of stone golems,” said one of them. “You can have them if you like.”
The dwarf’s eyes shined and he agreed that he would become their personal barber. Then they said goodbye and the four friends left the troll cave. It was getting dark outside and it was time they headed home, lest they want their parents to grow worried.
“Well, that was quite something,” commented Krunch, once they were out.
“I think we’ve learned an important lesson here,” said Nuala and raised her finger.
“Oh yeah? What's that?” asked Dornolin, not really interested. He carried an armful of gems.
“I think we learned we shouldn’t judge someone simply for how they look and what others say about them.”
“Word,” said Krunch.
“You’re right, Nuala,” agreed Desmond.
“Mhm,” mumbled Dornolin.
Nuala smiled. She was happy, knowing there was a pixie tucked safely in her pocket, one that she stole from the trolls with her magic.

,Kids,"The door opened suddenly and there he was.
''Hi, I'm Johan. It's great to meet you!'' he said with a big bright smile.
She looked at him in disbelief. Enthusiasm was not something she was used to seeing at work. Everyone was always in a bad mood or looking bored, always complaining about something. There were no gleams of excitement in anyone's eyes apart from the
times when they'd get a tip. The bigger the tip, the brighter the gleam.
Yet there it was, the bright gleam with no apparent reason for it. 
''I'm Anna, welcome to the team!'' she said, concluding that it must be first day excitement in his eyes and nothing more.
Anna had worked in that particular hotel since 1 year and had another job on the side, night shifts mainly in a casino. She was also a full-time student. She'd just shared all this with Johan over lunch in the canteen and he was now the one in disbelief.
 
''But how does that work?
When do you do everything? ''
''I honestly have no idea. I'm on auto-mode most of the time. I simply have no choice. And so I do it. ''
 
For Johan this was madness.
He'd just landed in London from a country where having 2 jobs whilst studying was not really heard of. It was to be the first reality hit on his travelling adventure. As time passed, Johan and
Anna became close, but not in the way everyone suspected they were. They would go out after work as many times as Anna's schedule allowed it and sometimes they would have their own secret parties during work. It was Anna that started this form of ‘’rebellion’’ as she called it.
''Good morni.......aaahahahahahah ...what is going on here? Looks like a night club''
Johan said amused. Anna had turned all the lights off in the tiny
underground bunker of an office that was the hotel's switchboard. She was blasting The Smiths’ There is a Light that Never Goes Out from her office computer. Only fitting, seen as her PC was most likely from the 80s judging by its looks.
‘’It’s a rebellion!!’’ she said, leaning in to hug him through the small counter window and letting out a huge loud laughter.
‘’Come in and join the party, you got 20 minutes of shennanigans till your shift starts!’’
Johan went in holding two cups of strong coffee. He always brought one for Anna especially when he knew she was finishing a  night shift like that day. He made it a thing to go in early just so they could catch up. It made his day.
‘’Whooops, gotta turn the lights back on now, big boss’s gonna walk by very soon. Back to reality’’, she said with a cheeky and tired look in her eyes.
It was things like this that drew them closer. Time spent together went by faster than a rocket, filled with laughter, banter and sparks of connection. In the little spare time they had together, the activity of choice was merely always live gigs. Anna particularly loved being in the presence of live music.
‘’It makes me feel so alive’’ she said emphatically.
 
One Thursday evening they met up to attend a live music night at a pub near Portobello Road that Anna had discovered. But Johan had a dinner date so he first met his date Jen in the restaurant area of the pub. He promised Anna they would join her upstairs soon as they had a bite to eat. He wasn’t in luck that night though, his date turned out to be a 
 as he put it. As this woman kept talking and talking about herself, he realised she had no questions for him whatsoever and slowly started thinking about teleporting himself upstairs where Anna was. ''What am I doing here?'', he thought.
To his relief, his date suddenly got up and said she has to leave and he quickly paid the bill and started walking up the stairs towards the pub’s attic where the concert was, when he suddenly heard Anna's cry ‘’Hurry up mate, you’re missing it!!!!’’
As he rushed up the stairs he realised she was not waiting for him by the stage but at the end of this dark corridor.
‘’Come on, follow me!!’’ she said walking through a door onto this roofless balcony.
As he stepped on the crackling wood he felt cold tingles on his face. He couldn’t believe it. It was snowing! He had never seen snow before. Anna stood about a metre away, studying his face with the brightest gleam in her eyes.",Anna and Johan
,Kids,"Lovely grew up in terraced mountains yellow with Christmas sunflowers. 
             “It’s kinda funny,” Amanda said, as they walked the SM mall together. 
             “What?” Lovely asked.
             “The song,” she said.
Lovely didn’t understand at first. Perhaps it was the timing. Christmas music started in August. Amanda waited until after Thanksgiving before she would play it herself. But then Amanda was American. 
“I don’t know,” Amanda said, apologetically. It was hard to know how much Amanda’s awkwardness was her and how much was just being foreign. “It’s just strange. I mean, you don’t even have snow.”
“I didn’t know you knew so much Tagalog,” Lovely said, finally realizing what she was talking about.
“I don’t,” Amanda said, “Just 
and 
, that kind of stuff. I’ve been trying to learn Ilocano but I still only know 
. Not enough to actually talk. But I know the music of ‘Let It Snow’.”
“You should learn Igorot,” Lovely told her.
“Do you know how hard it is to find anything to help learn just Ilocano?” Amanda asked.
Lovely switched the subject back, “I’d like to see snow someday.”
That was enough to get Amanda gushing. “Oh, I would love to take you to see your first winter! And to see snow! I mean, not everybody likes it, but it’s so beautiful! And you can go sledding, and do snowball fights, make snow angels, and go ice fishing! And oh, at night! When the moon is up and reflected off fresh snow and everything seems so quiet and lovely and clean like the world was made new!”
But that was a long time ago. Amanda had left years ago to attend college in the U.S. They still spoke on Facebook sometimes, but it wasn’t the same as walking together up and down Session Road or studying together in Burnham Park.
Lovely had also gone to college, for nursing. But it didn’t pay well in the Philippines. There were too many nursing students doing their volunteer work. So, she left, joined the legion of Overseas Filipino Workers.
Not to snow or cold, at first. Sand and high rich buildings of the United Arab Emirates. It was good work, paid well. She learned Arabic to help her patients more. But she didn’t want to stay. 
She got a U.S. work visa and moved. She learned to drive and got a car. She rented a hardwood house. American apartments had annoying carpet that she could never be confident were completely clean.
Winter was coming. 
Her coworkers had talked about it, lamented that they didn’t have the money to retire to Florida. They said she must have been lucky, growing up in a tropical country. She got the feeling they thought she could see the beach from her house. Baguio was cold, she told them, in the rainy season. They asked her how cold and she had to look it up on her phone to convert from Celsius. They laughed when she told them. She was wearing two coats in November when some of them were still going around in short-sleeves.
None of them seemed to have the same wonder and excitement about it that Amanda had long ago. Snow was a nuisance, something that had to be scraped off of windshields, shoveled out of driveways, and be wary of on the roads.
She hoped it wouldn't be that bad. Perhaps, it was a problem with age. Things were different when you were an adult. Only children got snow days off. Adults didn't have time for snowmen or snowball fights.
She did hope there would be snow for Christmas. It was hard enough already, being alone. She didn't have vacation days yet and her mother had not been able to get a visiter's visa. She missed the star-shaped parol lanterns and the children caroling for candy and coins. She missed the house stuffed so full of family that she tripped over them in the living room on the way to the bathroom at night.  She even missed the marshmallow and hot dog skewers her aunt used to make.
""Christmas is the hardest time,"" Amanda said, years ago.  It wasn't about snow although Amanda said it was hard that it didn't even look like Christmas with all the greenery.  It was the loneliness, the absence of family, and tradition, the loss of home. 
You forgot, sometimes, when you were busy, and hospitals were often busy. And it wasn’t all the time. She had fun a lot of the time, and she was sure that Amanda had fun, too. She had gotten several messages about how Amanda missed her and the mountains and she had tried making pancit noodles but it didn’t taste the same without kalamansi. The chicken adobo had turned out better. 
Amanda had been terribly disappointed that Lovely didn’t move closer. She had wanted to come and see her but her family was coming in and on a teacher’s salary, she couldn’t quite afford the trip over, “But now I won’t be able to see you experience your first winter and it’s going to be so exciting!”
She didn’t feel excited. She felt tired. Three 12 hour shifts, bed called. She answered. 
She woke to gentle white flakes floating outside her window. Amanda was right. It was something serene, and clean, and lovely. Softly, they fell and gathered to cover the ground. She got a cup of coffee and just sat and watched. Slowly, slowly, they fell. The sky was grey, the air was calm.
It was her first winter. That deserved some exploration. She grabbed her thickest pants, doubled her socks, two coats, a scarf, and a hat. Pulled her boots on. She hoped that would be enough.
There was something about being the first to leave prints on the sidewalk. The air was crisp. Her breath came out fluffy. Ice crystals sparkled from naked trees. Her heart was soothed from the beeping of yesterday’s monitors and machines. Her cheeks flushed. Winter was lovely, indeed.
             
             ",From Mountains of Sunflowers
,Kids,"                 It was our first time traveling to Angel Fire, New Mexico for a winter vacation. Well, it was our first time traveling for a winter vacation, ever. My parents decided to try something new, and instead of giving presents, they wanted to give an experience. I think they read about that on some “yummy-mummy” blog, and figured skiing would be an experience that even they could enjoy. 
           My sister and I were six and four, respectfully, and had been amped by our parents prior to our travel that this would be “fun, Fun, FUN!” (their words, not mine). I didn’t know much of what was going on and just went along for the ride, whereas my sister filtered in and out of tantrums whenever she realized she wouldn’t get the Spinning Sky Dancers toy she wanted. 
           It was pretty late when our plain landed, so everything outside our window looked bleak and black. Dad tried to convince mom that driving there would work better, living only one state over to the left, but mom claimed our car couldn’t handle the strain of driving in below freezing weather. I think she just didn’t want to be stuck in a car for 13 hours with complaining children. My sister and I couldn’t take in the full scene of New Mexico since it was nearly midnight and we fell asleep on the flight there. 
           The first thing I noticed was the silence. I could hear everyone’s breathing, uninterrupted from honking cars or police sirens. Since I didn’t know we had shifted locations while sleeping, I panicked and woke my parents in the adjoining bed in our open concept cabin. Spatial reasoning and object permanence are still relatively new concepts to a toddler. 
           After my dad reassured me and made himself coffee, the sun started breaching over the horizon. The glistening snow-scape brightened by the sun’s rays invited us to go play. Wrapped in thrift store coats and gloves, the two of us ventured outside, while my mother and sister prepped breakfast. 
           My introduction to winter started with a few icicles dangling from the porch railing, making the cabin look as if it wore a crystal necklace. My right hand gripped the railing as my dad guided my teetering descent with my left hand in his. Once on the gravel drive, my ambition took over, and I immediately ran to the nearest patch of snow. First inspection was with my foot, followed by handprints. Next came cupping the snow and tossing it skywards just to watch it fall back to its frozen brethren. My father just stood there and laughed as I repeated this routine over and over again. 
           “Hey, let’s explore around the cabin,” he suggested. Thinking back on it now, the space between neighboring cabins rested between 2-3 yards apart with half a dozen conifer trees in-between, but to a kid who grew up in a central-city district, it looked like miles of forest encircled us. My experience with snow remained limited to the edges of the driveway, and the thought of investigating further into the woods sent me trembling.
           The first few steps out, nothing seemed abnormal. Dad in the lead, he seemed to shrink before me with each step. I froze to watch the horror show that was my father being enveloped by the snow. 
           I screamed, “Stop! Daddy, stop!” He turned back at me to see what caused me to be so hysterical. 
           “The snow! It’s eating you!” I shouted. He trudged back towards me with a smile on his face.
           “No it isn’t, sweetheart, see.” He reached to pick me up, and continued on with his walk. I looked and saw that the snow did stop elevating around him at a certain point, which didn’t exactly reach his knee, but aligned significantly higher than his ankle, and receded back to a normal height. It only took a few steps with me in tow for my dad’s breathing to become labored, and hot tuffs of steam exploded from his mouth.
           “The air is much thinner here than I expected. This is no joke.” He awkwardly shifted me to his other hip, but finally gave up this method of trekking and asked, “Do you think you are ready to try walking on your own?”
           I shook my head vigorously, and imaged a serpent lying beneath the snow, ready to jump out and devour me. “It will be okay,” he told me, as he set me down. “See, there you are. Just put your feet in the same spots I put my feet. Then you will know you are walking on safe ground.” He walked on with out, and I knew I had two choices: stay and get eaten, or walk with him. 
           Following his advice, each step I took was a strained stride to match his gate. I couldn’t really look around at the property surrounding us, as I was too focused on eyeing the earth. It became apparent that my apprehensions were silly, and this was actually fun, I looked up and around at the marvel of a snowy winter. At a certain point, I noticed that the trail behind us only had one set of footprints.     
           “Hey,” I thought, “I want my own foot prints too!”
           Jumping around my dad to make my own impressions, we waded about, kicking and flinging snow with each step. Feeling braver now, I even allowed myself to fall back to make snow angels, which looked more like snow Mr. Potato Head. 
           A shout from the back window beckoned us to breakfast, and we trudged back in a pathetic attempt at a race. Before stepping inside, we shook the snow particles off our clothes as much as we could. We thought there would be plenty of opportunities to revisit the snow, but that weekend kept getting warmer and warmer, and it all evaporated by the time we left. 
           Getting to tube down a bunny slope was all my parents could afford in way of skiing, which ended up being fine, since my dad caught altitude sickness. A few days after Christmas, my sister forgot about never receiving presents from our parents, since our aunt and uncles were able to provide some items for her. She never did get that Spinning Sky Dancers, though, which was probably for the better, since some kid lost an eye to one the year after. 
           We attempted another sky vacation when I was a teenager, but it couldn’t compare to that first experience with snow. It’s funny to think on how naïve I was, but my dad took the opportunity to give me life long advice. 
           As we finished eating our breakfast of pancakes and eggs, my dad leaned over to whisper, 
           “Any time you feel very fearful, I will take the first steps in front of you, and you can follow in my steps, until you know that you can take your own steps.”",First Steps in Snow
,Kids,"It's cold, I'm shivering, but I don't know why. I can't understand it, sometimes it's warm, and sometimes it's cold; but today is very cold. My blanky isn't enough, no matter how much I snuggle up, I'm still cold. I feel my eyes sting as they become damp with tears, my bottom lip quiver and I can't contain it anymore. I cry, crying means comfort, crying means mum. It doesn't take her too long to find me; a moment later I find myself being picked up and held against her nice warm body. I sigh contentedly. When she hugs me, I don't just feel warm on the outside, I feel warm on the inside too. I think it's love, I love my mummy and daddy. They always make me smile and feel safe. I hear her cooing at me. ""Awww, what's wrong Amilia?""
I open my mouth to try and speak but all that comes out is ""Cooo,"" in a high pitched squeak. That always happens. I want to speak, I want to tell them what's in my head but my mouth doesn't work. I've been working on it for a while now. Sometimes my words start out with the right sound, but all that ever comes out is an unintelligible squeak or cry. Because I can't speak, I act instead. I snuggle as close to mum as I can and let out a loud and happy sigh to tell her I was alright now.
""Were you cold? Aww baby. Don't worry, I'm here now and it's morning. Let's get you into some warm clothes."" I don't want her to put me down, that means loss of warmth. Fortunately, I have a very smart mum, she always knows what to do. She calls in dad, and together they get me dressed, barely having to put me down. It's much warmer now I've been put in clothes. I let out a happy gargle. Mum carries me downstairs and puts me in my high chair. I never like the food they give me, but I like the grumbly pangs of hunger in my stomach even less. So I swallow my food (... okay, most of my food. Fine! Enough of my food to not be hungry and let dad wear the rest. Maybe next time they can pick nicer airplanes to eat) and let them pick me up again. Mum puts me down a few seconds later to put something warmer and cosier on, I like my jacket, it's like a blanket I can move around in, and picks me up before opening the door. The cold air greets me, I can't help the screech that comes out as I bury my head in mum's clothes. I don't want to look up. It's warm here. Mum doesn't seem to like that though. She shifts me away and exposes me to the cold. Not having a choice, I open my eyes.
White.
All I can see is white.
The rooftops are covered in it, the cars are covered in it, the ground seems to be made of it.
I hear a crunch as dad moves towards me, I look at him, then look down, following his footsteps in the white. Each step he makes, makes a crunching noise. It isn't like anything I've ever heard before. All I can tell is that the white stuff looks soft. No longer worried about the cold, I move my hand downwards and make grabby motions. I want to touch. Dad bends down and when he stands up, the white is in his hands. I lean towards him with my insisting motions. I don't know what the stuff is, all I know is that I want to find out. He comes closer and brings his hands to mine. I grab a handful but immediately let go with a squeal. It is cold! It's cold like the ice I played with from the big cold box in the kitchen. Dad laughs, dropping the snow which causes me to frown, before taking my hands in his and putting gloves on me. I've never really liked gloves, they make my fingers feel funny, but I understand the need for them... kind of. Things are warmer with them on. With my hands all wrapped up, I reach for the ground again wanting to feel the white. Dad picks more up and I take it greedily. It isn't as cold this time. It's squishy to touch. I want to see how much I can squish it but I don't want to ruin the beautiful thing in my hands. I decide there is more than enough on the ground, so I clench my fist. It moves in my hand and makes the same crunching sound it made under dad's feet. I bring it up to my face to inspect it before promptly putting it in my mouth. Despite wearing gloves, the temperature of the white is still cold in my mouth. I decide I don't want it there so I push it out with my tongue. Mum laughs, using her sleeve to clean off my face. I try my best to shake her off before struggling to get down. I want to look closer, I want to make crunchy footprints too. Mum bends down and sits me in the white. I feel myself sink to the ground and shiver as the cold works its way through my clothes. I hadn't noticed before, but I certainly did now, that it's wet. Wet like water, or ice once it's been in my hand too long. I look out across the ground, and am mesmerised by the glimmering light shining off the floor. It's amazing. I grab another handful experimentally and throw it away from me in the air. It hits the ground and breaks apart, all that is left is a disturbance in the smooth white ahead. I make a gargle of amusement before picking up another handful and throwing it at dad. It hits his leg and he laughs, bending down to pick up a handful himself and chuck it back. I hold out my hand to catch it but it breaks apart as it touches my glove, slipping through my fingers. Most of it hits my body or sticks to my glove but a small amount lands on my nose. I go cross eyed trying to look at it before letting out a shrieking laugh and shaking it off.
I look ahead, across the ground again, before making my decision. Today I would walk, by myself, and make crunchy footsteps just like dad. I lean forward and get my feet under me. Here comes the tricky bit. I push off with my hands and stand up, I feel myself stumble and fall back on my bum. Mum's hand comes under me and raises me to my feet again. I would say thank you if I knew how, but I don't, so I can't. I put one foot in front of the other as slowly as I can and I hear a crunch as my foot gets closer to the solid ground. Once my foot is under me, I do the same to the other. I manage to make three steps before I fall, but that is enough.
My parents cheer and I gargle, in my own version of a cheer, along with them. I hear a snap of a camera and mum squeal, ""Her first footsteps, and her first footsteps in the snow!""
Huh, so that's what it's called, 'snow'. Mum picks me up and gives me a big hug, I am glad to be back in the warmth but I miss the snow already. I struggle to get down but mum doesn't loosen her hold. I tap her shoulder and she looks at me, I point to the ground then look back at her. This time I would do it. I would make a word. I open my mouth and concentrate on what their mouths looked like when they said the word. ""Shhh,"" I say but it isn't quite right. I was missing the end. I frown and try again. ""Shnow"" I manage eventually. Mum and dad clap and cheer, and that night I'm even given one of the few foods I like in celebration. I say the word again as mum tucks me into bed, ""shnow!"" I give her a big smile and she smiles back, telling me how proud she is of me. Dad comes in a moment later and wraps his arm around mum as he watches me, before he opens his mouth and starts to sing. As I close my eyes and feel myself drift away, I can't help but reflect on all I had discovered today. The one thing that sticks with me though is, 'as much as I don't like the cold, the snow makes it worth it'.
 I fall asleep that night feeling loved, warm, and happy.",Footsteps in the snow

In the noisy, bright, and mysterious world of Manhattan, there was Marjorie. She was eight. She had long curly hair and dark brown eyes that saw more than most grown-ups in their whole lives. She could see people’s hearts and their true nature, she could see a “good egg” in even the most devilish of faces. And though she lived in a world where she was doing her best to spread happiness and joy, no one ever spoke to her, at least not that she knew for Marjorie was deaf. She was born in California and for the first time in her life she was sitting by a chilly window, watching the snow fall down past where her eyes could see and land softly on the ground. She sat near that window for hours and watched the first snow of her life. But more than watching it she wanted to feel it, she wanted to be cold from its soft touch and to shiver with excitement after making a snow man. But Marjorie wasn’t alone up in her apartment, she was with her mother who didn’t allow Marjorie to go outside and play in the snow. So, as she sat dreaming with her eyes closed and wondering what it be like to feel the snow, she got an idea.
Suddenly, Marjorie threw open the window and felt the cold breeze on her skin just as she’d imagined. She climbed down the fire escape and nearly slipped once or twice on the transparent ice. But quicker than a flash she was looking up at the window she was once sitting in and didn’t see a lonely little girl sitting there anymore. Marjorie raced up and down the sidewalk, feeling the crunchy snow, she waved to other pedestrians who were shivering and frowning. If you looked at the street that evening, you would have seen New York in its usual manner and one little girl dancing in the snow.
When Marjorie looked up at the sky and saw the snow falling down on her face, it felt shocking, the cold drops hit her skin like tiny pebbles piercing through a blanket. But she liked it, she liked it so much, she decided to make a wish. “I’d give everything I have just to hear the city in the snow!” she said in her head and as she did, she took her penny, which was everything she had and tossed it up to the sky! When the penny fell upon the ground it caused a disturbance in the snow, making a small “poof”! Marjorie’s eyes grew big as she knelt down to the penny and tossed it again, sure enough the “poof” was there! She could hear it! Her heart beat ten times as fast, blood rushed to her cheeks and she stood gleaming with joy, on the sidewalk. She couldn’t believe her own ears! She took a step back from where she came and there it was! The crunch of the snow! She heard her footsteps and laughed! With her heart racing she picked her feet and rushed back home!
Oh! The sounds of the city were heaven! There were cars honking loudly at one another. People on the sidewalk calling out. “TAXI!” there was a man sitting in a big coat on the side walk who looked at Marjorie and spoke to her, with his hand stretched out he said, “Anything helps?” Marjorie would have given him the world if she had it, but she didn’t, all she had was the penny. Marjorie stopped to hear him speak, for his was the first voice she had ever heard spoken to hear. It was a wonderful feeling, one that brought joy to her heart! With a smile, she turned and looked to her home, she didn’t have to look far. Her mother was looking for her, she was walking the sidewalk in her big winter coat.  Marjorie looked at her with piercing vision, concentrating on her voice, waiting to hear it for the first time. But her mother was too far away still, the stranger speaking on the streets were unfamiliar sounds, though Marjorie liked to hear them, she wanted to hear her mother.
Marjorie’s concentration was interrupted when the man sitting on the sidewalk began to cough. It was a scary sound, Marjorie didn’t like it at all. It was irritating like when she felt her dog barking ring in her chest. The man’s eyes turned red from the cough as he put his hand over his mouth. Marjorie looked at him, sadly. She wanted to help him, “perhaps” she thought “the penny will make his wishes come true too.” It was a nice thought and Marjorie’s arm extended towards him with the penny concealed within her fist. “But” a thought prevented her, “what if I lose mine?” Marjorie looked for her mother and saw she was nearly there! If she could only wait for mother to come close enough! She just wanted to hear her voice. But the man’s voice was much closer. His hand was extended as he smiled at Marjorie, not wanting to frighten her.
Marjorie took a deep breath and placed the penny in his hand. She was sad about giving up her wish, but she got to hear the snow, didn’t she? That was what the wish was for after all. But as Marjorie’s hands were leaving the penny, she felt a hand on her shoulder. Marjorie turned and saw her mother, kneeling down to face her, “Marjorie!” she said in a lovely voice. It was soft and pretty but filled with emotion! “You scared me.” She embraced Marjorie and took her hands from the penny by accident. As you can imagine, when Marjorie left the penny in the hands of someone else, she lost her wish. But the little girl wasn’t sad about it, she got to hear her mothers voice! She carries it with her still, the sweet sound of her mother calling after her.
She walked home hand in hand with her mother and wore a bright smile. As for the beggar, I do not know what happened to him, but Marjorie never saw him sitting on the street again. Once she passed a man, who was dressed in nice clothes and a tall hat on that same street, he bowed and winked at Marjorie after saving her from a nasty slip a few winters later. Marjorie thought “that could have been him!” but then you again, she couldn’t be sure.
All we truly know is this, winter can be cold, gloomy and dark. It makes many people sad and takes the pleasure out of doing even the simplest of things. But for those that walk with warmth in their hearts and spirit of giving, the first fall of snow can be truly magical.

,Kids,"	We’re in a car on a highway and I don’t know where we’re going. What I do know is as we drive there are less trees with big leaves and coconuts and more trees with no leaves. I never knew there were trees without leaves. But, maybe all these trees are dead. We’re in a car and going in mostly one direction. There are big signs in the middle above us and I don’t care about those. What I do care about are the different shade of gray (everything is gray) signs on the right side of the highway. If I see one of those signs and I whine, my owner usually will pull over at something she calls a rest stop where there are other dogs and I can go potty outside.  
	But the places we’re stopping at are different than the places we stopped at earlier. In some places there are clear hard things hanging from the sides of roofs. Sometimes they drip water and my master, her name is Clarisse, lets me lap up the water. I do a number one and number 2 and I get really excited until Clarisse gives me a bone treat. It’s feeling a little bit colder though. The grass where I go potty is even cold. I didn’t think grass could be cold. But, we get back in the car and Clarisse tells me she’ll turn the heater on. I’ve never heard of a heater, but it feels nice. Hot air, probably saved from home, comes through the openings at the front of the car.
	We continue to drive in the same direction. Then, some strange things start happening. Like after night, I start to see very small white pebbles flying onto the windshield, but Clarisse doesn’t seem concerned. She smiles and puts on the windshield wipers which I always thought were just for rain. But after an hour, this stuff really starts coming down. I can barely see anything out the window. So, she decides to pull over and turn something she calls the emergency lights on. I’m so confused. Please Clarisse, keep the warm air from Florida coming. As we wait, something else weird happens. Hard clear things start growing on the windshield. Maybe they’re insects or an animal, so I bark at them, but Clarisse hushes me and turns a knob. After fifteen minutes, whatever it is disappears.  
	We keep driving and I see a light gray sign so I moan and Clarisse pulls over. The van slides for a moment and we’re both scared. I wish we had stayed in Florida, but she gains control of the car and pulls into a parking spot. There’s no grass here. This cold white stuff has eaten all the grass. I also can’t get a firm paw down since this white stuff is slippery. I go potty as best I can but I’m shivering, cold, and miserable. I wish we could turn and go back to nice warm Florida, but I’m not driving.
	I see another sign and have to go but the white stuff is everywhere and I know it’s eaten all the grass here too, so I stay silent.  Clarisse has to go potty though, so she pulls over, leaves me in the car, goes in the building, and comes back for me. When she shuts off the engine, the air from Florida stops coming. I’m not sure why. But Clarisse walks me and it’s miserable. She goes back and puts on a coat and something called gloves. She puts a coat on me and I don’t resist, even though I hate clothes. She says we’ll be at our destination in five hours. I just hope this isn’t where we’re going to stay forever. Please Clarisse, let this visit be short.  Very short. I miss Florida already.    ",Chihuahua Fur
,Kids,"	I haven’t quite been acclimatized yet. I’m in a large farmhouse in Connecticut, just an hour from New York City. I’m renting this farmhouse mansion for less than most people would pay for a closet-sized space in Brooklyn, but it is for good reason. The federal judge who owns it travels and is never at home, and when I graduated from Fordham and got accepted to NYU, my professor recommended me as a house-sitter. The job definitely has its perks. Picture a sun-dappled road and a post and rail fence that jogs through a green field to a hilltop. There’s a weeping willow in the front yard, a fishpond, a state-of-the-art granite kitchen, Jenn-Air oven and all the comforts of life. Ironic, I think to myself again and again. The judge worked so hard for all this. He’s never here.
               So much the better for me. I also dog-sit for the judge. He has two golden retrievers, Remy and Seven, although their real names are something much longer. No doubt the judge paid handsomely for the two most coddled hunting dogs in the state of Connecticut. He told me that he’d flown to Wyoming to pick them up. Apparently, the best goldens have square heads. I wonder how much squarer Remy’s and Seven’s heads are compared to a shelter dog. But then Remy and Seven are low maintenance. As long as I take them out for their morning run, they are good. In fact, they don’t chew, they don’t bark, and when I accidentally left the cold smoked, organic grass-fed brisket on the picnic table in the summer, they didn’t touch it. Almost weird.
               Anyway, that was the judge’s house in the summer. Now it’s after Christmas. Finals are over, but classes haven’t started yet. The sky was blue earlier, but now it’s almost opaque, with a fine, thin but consistent haze of snow beginning to blanket everything. It’s almost alarming, actually. My cell phone, which I hadn’t realized was plugged in to local weather, blared about sudden snow squalls and danger out of doors at least three times already. It doesn’t bother me. The house is stocked with food, and alcohol, and classes don’t start for another week and a half, so it’s just me and the dogs. We are watching snow cover the fields, the branches, the tire swing over the pond. Even the birds have stopped chirping. Silence hangs over the world outside.
               I almost failed to see it. On the winding road up to the judge’s house, it is now unmistakable. There is a car, an SUV, covered in snow, but stationary.  I squint to see it through the thick white veil that the snow squalls have become. It is undeniably a vehicle. I flash back to the words of my father before I left home for school—carry a towel in the back of your car, it’ll provide traction if you ever get caught in the snow. Dear old Dad. I love him, but I knew I’d likely not have to worry. This close to New York, I almost always used the public transportation. Now I thought of his words as I watched a figure exit the vehicle. The figure made no effort to move the car. Must realize the futility of it, I thought.
               I was aware that the inevitable was about to occur. I thought I could see movement. The driver, with hands up around his face was slowly making his way on foot to the judge’s house. I was alone, in the middle of the country, hours from any type of civilization, and a stranger was approaching. I braced myself. I’m not afraid of strangers, but it wouldn’t take long for a person to pick up on the fact that I was alone, a slightly built, rather overprotected law student living in the country with two mild-mannered hunting dogs. It would be a perfect target for a burglary.
               It would be slow progress on foot for the stranger to make his way to the house. I thought for a moment. My cousin was, geographically, my closest relative at this point. She lived in Manhattan, a financial advisor for one of the big firms. She would be able to get to the farmhouse in an hour and a half . . . under normal circumstances. These were not normal circumstances, though. My phone blared again. Apparently, the trains were closed due to the weather. The entire city had shut down. At least I should text anyway. And I did: Hi Lauren, big snow just checking in. Stranger’s car broke down. Call when you have a minute.
               Message back: I’m driving with Do Not Disturb on. Please try back shortly.
               Argh. Lauren. She’s so annoyingly proper sometimes. I’d forgotten that she’d been away for the holidays. She was probably driving up from some vacation destination, oblivious to the state of the weather in Connecticut. My thoughts were cut short by a knock at the door.
               There was no choice now. I had to open it. Or did I? For one brief moment, I paused, thinking that I could pretend to not be at home. The snow continued to squall and the alert on my phone blared again. Damned phone. No choice now, I had to open the door. It creaked and didn’t seem to want to open at first. When it finally did, I felt a blast of cold air as tiny crystals of snow blew in and covered my face and eyelashes, turning to cold water that made me shudder and shiver. I stepped back.
               He was tall, about six foot three, and covered in snow, from his already salt-and-pepper hair to the shoes on his feet, cap-toed business shoes that were soaked and damaged from the wet, heavy snow that continued to pour down outside. 
               Can I come in? he wanted to know.
               Of course.
               He was handsome, in the way that an older man can be. His hair was longish, in a style that had been fashionable a few years ago. He didn’t look like a burglar. He might be interesting. I remembered my first winter in New York and when I’d walked out into a puddle in the train station. The water had slowly seeped into my high heels, footwear that I’m not comfortable wearing anyway, and with each step the leather seemed to stretch until my stockings were black and my toes were prune-y from exposure to water. I’d walked for what seemed like miles until I’d finally taken the shoes off and walked barefoot on the dirty, wet sidewalks. It’d still been an improvement from the heavy, awkward wetness of my shoes, which I’d dropped directly into the trash can upon finally arriving at home.
               “You can take off your shoes if you want.”
               “I was on my way to a colleague’s house when my car got stuck”, he said. “Do you know Neville Katz?”
               How disappointing, I thought to myself. He’s an impresser. Everybody knows Neville Katz, including the judge. The judge’s description of the house even included the reference to Neville Katz. The judge lived in the same neighborhood as the reality TV mogul. Asking whether I knew Neville Katz was like asking if I’d heard of the President of the United States.
               “I’m his script writer,” the stranger volunteered. “I was on my way to a meeting with Neville when my gas ran out. Any chance I could stay until I can get to a gas station?”
               The stranger saw the confusion on my face.
               “Yes,” he chuckled. “We write scripts for reality TV, too. The stuff that happens is still real, but we just need to make sure that it’s interesting, so we sketch out a broad script and our cast is welcome to depart from it, if necessary.”
               “Yes, yes, of course. The nearest gas station is a mile away, but I’m sure they’ll be closed in the squalls. Come in. You can take off your shoes, and make some calls if you want.”
               Hm. Maybe this would be interesting after all. I was not shocked. I didn’t watch reality TV, but I was familiar with the premise. Neville’s shows usually involved some upper-class princesses who posed as housewives who became jealous of one another and then fought. It would actually take some ingenuity to come up with a fresh plot line each week to spawn a fresh round of housewife jealousy.
               I heard his stomach growl. He tried to ignore it.
               I didn’t want to embarrass him, but the stomach growling was loud enough not to ignore. I was beginning to get hungry myself. It was approaching the dinner hour. The sky was still strangely light, a side effect of the great squalls of snow that continued to shower down from the sky.
               “I was just about to make dinner. Would you care to join?”
               He agreed in the swift easy manner of someone who was used to having his needs met. For a minute, I imagined if I’d been the stranger at his house. I’d have been apologetic about the stomach rumble, tentative about inviting myself to dinner. He appeared to have none of these hang-ups.
               “What’re you making?” he wanted to know.
               I’d planned salmon, but there was not enough for two. I mentally scanned the cupboards and came up with “pasta.” He offered to help and I watched as he took stock of what was on the shelves: a tiny can of sardines, some olives. He eyed Chianti that I’d purchased at the wine store the other day. I’d been wanting to drink it. Why not share it with a stranger?
               “We can open a bottle of wine?” I offered.
               An hour later I was on my second glass of wine twirling the most delicious pasta puttanesca on my fork.  It was salty and tangy, and I found myself reaching for the wine glass more frequently than I usually do. He was funny. Not surprising, I thought to myself. He’s a scriptwriter. He’s a paid raconteur, and it was obvious that he’d had much practice with his trade. He talked about spoiled actors and set mishaps and run-ins with the law. I found myself laughing, then laughing harder, and then (the worst!) laughing so hard that tiny tears were forming at the corners of my eyes, threatening to roll down my cheeks. I couldn’t catch my breath. And yet it was so invigorating.
               He laughed only lightly, and the corners of his eyes wrinkled with crow’s feet that turned upward. Only there was something unsettling about him. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. He had large dark eyes, and there seemed to be something strange about them. I finally saw what it was. His eyelashes were curled. I could tell because I did this regularly with my own lashes. It opened up my eyes and made them look larger. They seemed bigger, more movie star-like. And yet, when I imagined him curling his eyelashes before a mirror in the morning, I cringed. It seemed unmanly. Those entertainment industry types lead a different lifestyle, I supposed. I wondered if his pinkish lips had been enhanced with gloss. 
               I then castigated myself for making judgments like the provincial girl that I was. It was as though I’d never met anyone outside my conservative neighborhood in Florida. Surely there was a world of sophistication and fun, of adventure and hijinks that was waiting to be experienced by those who were not hemmed in my their backgrounds.
               The sky was finally growing dark, and I became faintly aware that I would have to broach the awkward subject of making sleeping arrangements. I toyed with my glass and looked out the window. He seemed to sense what I was thinking. I saw him smile slightly through his curled lashes. “Would it be OK if I slept in the armchair in the living room, just till the snow clears?” he wanted to know. Now the wine seemed to be going to my head. Surely, I had to offer him a better option. There were three guest rooms in the house, all cozily outfitted with a tiny reading light, a tiny fireplace, and books. There were full hot showers in each, a private bathroom for two of them, and the refrigerator was large enough to feed an army. Surely, I couldn’t deny him what I’d provide to any guest. I led him to one just off the kitchen. He could sleep there for the evening. He opened another bottle of wine.
               My head swam after that. I’m not sure how much more wine I had to drink. I remember thinking that I should stop drinking alcohol and start drinking water, but the room was gyrating and I was beginning to go from feeling giddy to feeling slightly ill. I had to hold on to the walls as I walked the stranger to his room. I noticed that he had a small black bag with him, like a doctor’s bag. He held it close, and when I reached for it, to hand it to him, he quickly clasped it closer to him. This was the first time I’d noticed anything remotely like hostility in him. But it did appear to be hostility. Maybe even anger. His eyes flashed for just a moment at me and he said, with some bite in his voice that he could carry his own things. He must have seen the fear in my face, because he quickly apologized and explained that his bag contained the necessities for the script. Oddly, when he removed his coat and put his open bag on the bed, I spied a flash of chrome, what looked to be instruments or implements of a scientist or doctor.
               I had strange dreams that night. I tossed and turned. I dreamt of running. I felt breathless and desperate in my dream. But when I looked down at my legs, they refused to work. Out of a haze, the stranger’s face appeared, with his eyes exaggeratedly large, almost cartoonish. Long, ridiculous curled eyelashes fluttered when he spoke, and I became more and more alarmed. His lips were glossy and red, like a clown’s, and he reached both hands around my neck. I felt cold and tried to scream, but no sound came out. My legs remained dumb, heavy, unable to respond. At various times I seemed to realize that I was in a dream, but as soon as I felt relief, I would fall back asleep and the dream would resume with such convincing sensation that I again thought it was real. It felt as though I’d slept for days when I finally awoke at 10 a.m. the next day.
               The stranger was gone.
               The squalls had stopped by the time I awoke, and the sun had put a veil of crystals on the white hills around the judge’s house. I took Remy and Seven outside. There was no trace of where the SUV had stopped. It must have all been covered in additional snow from the squalls.
               I walked the mile to Pancik’s gas station down the road, Remy and Seven bounding alongside me in the drifts. But Sammy Pancik told me he’d received no calls the prior evening or in the morning.
               “Where’s the next closest gas station?” I wanted to know.
               “At least fifteen miles away, center of town, but you know that!” Sammy said.
               I did know that. But if the stranger’s car had been out of gas, he would have needed to get fuel from somewhere. I telephoned three gas stations in the vicinity. None had taken calls. None had delivered gas to a stranger.
               I was afraid to go back to the farmhouse, but I did it anyway, and I did it by myself. The rooms looked untouched. I thought that maybe some food was missing from the refrigerator, but I couldn’t be certain. Nothing was missing from the house. The only curious thing was that Remy no longer listened to my commands. Sometimes he would howl for no reason, and he could not be comforted. I found this so disconcerting that I wanted to look for another place to live.
               I only told Lauren about the stranger’s visit.
               “That’s what you get for drinking two bottles of wine by yourself,” she said.
               But even the judge noticed Remy’s strange behavior. He told me that he seemed different somehow, and I, not knowing what to say, simply nodded my head. When I think back on the stranger, I do not know what to make of his visit. I know only that when I gave my notice to the judge that I’d be finding a new place, he seemed disconcerted. He asked no questions, but only told me that things could be lonely for a foreigner in a Connecticut snowstorm.

,Kids,"“He should have eyes. Here.”
“What’re those?” 
“Rocks.”
“I can’t give him rocks for eyes.”
“Sure you can.”
“I won’t. Wait here.” 
I will. 
Wait here, that is. 
I think all I’ve ever done is wait—not that I’ve been at it long. 
I wasn’t, and then I was. And then I waited, and finally you came. You and your sister, tumbling and slipping and stumbling, working very hard to roll and shape and stack me. 
You’ve given me a good, sturdy body, just so. And long straight arms—though they don’t seem to do much—and a scarf around my neck so I “won’t catch a cold,” which I don’t really think is going to be a problem, but I appreciate the kindness anyway. 
“What’ve you brought?”
“Buttons,” you say.
“You’re right—that’s better.”
“Said so.” 
Then all at once I have eyes, and I can see. How perfect that the first thing I should see is you, red-cheeked and beaming up at me. 
“Happy?” asks your sister. And of course I am. 
“Yeah,” you tell her. “He’s perfect.”
“And I’m freezing. I’m going inside.”
“Okay.” 
Your sister stamps off through the white that goes up to her knees, but you stay, which I’m glad of, because you are my favourite anyhow. 
“You’re just completely perfect,” you tell me, but your mittened hands find things to fix just the same. My edges need smoothing, it would seem, and my head is maybe just a bit crooked, and my scarf is draped in not quite the most flattering way. And perhaps I’m apt to topple over, and so I should be stronger around the bottom. You pack and press and better me until you grow so warm that you shuck your mittens. 
Now that I’m sturdier I’m just right for sitting with. I’m glad to have you lean your head against me. If your head were crooked, I’d fix it for you in a jiffy. I’ll watch over you while you poke your fingers through the icy crust on the snow. Should anyone think to topple you, let them go through me first.
When you’ve crunched through all that you can reach and your fingers go red, you shake your hands wildly and tell me that they sting. 
Then—“Oh!” you gasp, and all at once you’re charging off, taking the path your sister forged for you right to the front door. 
I was alone before you made me, so I know how to be alone now, I think. 
Someone goes by, picking her way along the icy edge of your street. She’s much taller than you—whoever made her stacked her good and high—but she moves slowly, like she’s sure she’ll fall. She could use your help. She’s not very sturdy, and I’d hate to see her fall. Her hands—on arms that bend, unlike mine—are shoved down deep in her pockets. 
My head doesn’t turn, so I couldn’t look away if I wanted to, but that’s all right because I want to watch and see her go by safely. 
She’s made more reliably than I though, because she doesn’t slide even once in all the time I observe her. She disappears beyond my sight, and I wish her well on her way. 
Shortly after this, you return, flying out in a whirl of colours and clutching something in your hands. You’ve put on new mittens, I see. The other ones soaked through. 
“I brought these for you,” you say. “So we can match.” 
And onto the ends of my long, straight arms, you place mittens of my own, blue like yours and striped like my scarf. 
“Dad says it’s going to get colder tonight. I hope you’ll be warm enough.” 
It’s all right—I don’t need to be. Cold is my nature. But your gifts are wonderful, and I like them very much. 
“And I hope you like your nose. I picked out the orangest one instead of the straightest one.” 
That was kind of you. My nose is very fine. 
You look me over once again, and I try my best to look right for you. I’d like you to see that I’m complete and proper, because you’ve made me well and I know that I am. 
You must agree, because after some time, when your sister sticks her head out the door and hollers “
you give me a pat and race off again. 
You made me so I could live my first day, and after a while when things turn blue I get to live my first night. Your dad was right, and it does get colder, but that only means I get to spend more time with you. A fearsome wind blows, but lucky for me I’m very sturdy around the bottom. My scarf is wound tight, and half-frozen to my body, so it’s safe too. All in all I make it very well through the night, but by the bright white morning I’m crushed to realize that one of my mittens is gone and blown away. 
When the front door opens I long to be melted so you won’t have to see that I’ve lost your gift. 
But—oh—it’s your sister who marches out as fresh flakes start to float down. She’s on her way somewhere, I can tell from her walk and the bag that she carries. 
She passes me by at first, then doubles back. 
She frowns at me. 
“I 
the mittens were foolish,” she grumps. 
My bare twig-hand reaches out to her when she stomps away again. 
Are you awake yet? Have you looked out the window to see me? 
Your sister turns around a second time and approaches me. 
She plucks her own mitten right off her hand and jams it over mine. 
“This isn’t for you,” she tells me. “You’re snow. I need it more than you do.” 
But she leaves it with me anyway as she goes, because we both know this gift is to you. ",Birthday
,Kids,,Natalie vs. Nature
,Kids,"Sizzle, crackle, pop! The fire keeps me toasty warm. I get up from my cocoon of blankets in front of the fire place and run to the window. Still no snow. I had heard songs about winter and seen movies but it never snowed in Florida. I am spending Christmas with my Gramma in Michigan while my parents are on a trip. They are on something called a cruise and I’ve never been on one of those so I wanted to go with them a first but then they told me that Gramma gets snow in Michigan! I’ve  been here for a week and so far its been really super cold— like freezing! But still no snow. Gramma says to be patient and I’m trying but it’s so hard because I reeeeallly wanna see snow! I picture it coming down like pouring powdered sugar on my waffles. Then when it is all good and stuck on the earth I think it will look like whipped cream! All this talk of food is making me hungry. I run to the kitchen where Gramma is putting the last batch of cookies in the oven. 
“It smells amazing!” I exclaim
“Well hello there pumpkin! Would you like to help me taste test some of the cookies on the cooling rack?” Gramma smiled.
”Yes please! With a glass of milk!” 
I open the cupboard and grab my special mug. It was a Christmas mug with snowmen and children ice skating painted on it. Gramma said that was my special mug and no one else got to use it except me. She kept it on the bottom shelf so I could reach it. I brought the mug over to the table and Gramma poured the milk as I grabbed a warm cookie. I dunked the cookie in milk and then took a bite of the amazingly moist chocolate chip cookie with a perfect gooey center. 
Later that night Gramma and I were sitting by the fire and laughing and drinking hot cocoa. 
“This is so much fun! The only thing that could make this winter even better would be snow.” I looked over at the window longingly. 
“Maybe it will snow overnight,”Gramma said. “That’s the most magical thing about winter I think. When I was a little girl I loved waking up to a surprise snowfall.” 
I yawned “Well maybe tomorrow I will wake up to a beautiful blanket of snow on the ground.” 
The next morning I woke up to the sun shining through the cracks in the blinds. I had slept so well I didn’t want to get up. Something about being bundled up all snuggly warm really makes you resent the cold floor when you first step out of bed. Not to mention sleeping by the window in the winter it—the window! I jumped out of bed and ran to the window. I couldn’t wait to see if it had snowed overnight! I grabbed the chord for the blinds and tugged hard. The blinds flew up and the blinding white scene in front of me was so intense I had to squint. 
“Woah.” I mumbled enchanted by the silvery-white snow that glistened in the sun. 
I stood frozen in front of the window for a few more seconds, admiring the lovey winter landscape before rushing downstairs to tell Gramma. 
“Gramma Gramma! Did you see the snow!” I exclaimed as I bounded down the last few steps and rounded the corner to the living room. 
I was met with the sight of Gramma sitting in her rocking chair absentmindedly stirring the coffee in her  hand. She had turned her chair around to face the big picture window which had all the blinds wide open. She was staring at the beautiful snowy hills in the back yard. She turned to look at me as I scooted chair across the floor to sit next to her. 
“Hello pumpkin!” She said with a smile. “Isn‘t it so lovely sitting here watching it snow?” 
I looked out the window and she was right! It WAS snowing! 
”I didn’t notice it was STILL snowing.” I said as I walked closer to the window watching some of the dainty snowflakes brush past the window. 
“If you look closely enough, you’ll notice that each snowflake is unique. No two are the same!” She said. 
I sat with Gramma and drank hot chocolate watching the falling snow for what seemed like forever. 
“Well,” Gramma said “Are you gonna look at it all day or are you gonna go out and play in it?” 
I smiled and ran to the mud room to grab my boots, coat, and snow pants. 
“Do you have a sled? You have to come with me Gramma!” I shouted across the hall. 
“Well of course!” Gramma exclaimed stepping into the mud room in a full snow suit. “I can’t let you have ALL the fun!” 
We sledded and had snow ball fights for hours. We laughed and made snow angels, snowmen and all the ice sculptures we could until it felt like our fingers and toes would fall off. 
“Do we have... anymore... cookies?” I asked Gramma as I sat in the snow panting. 
“Yes... and egg... nog... too” Gramma replied panting as well as she sat down next to me. “Let’s catch our breath and then head inside.” 
Grandma and I laughed as we snuggled next to the fireplace. Our glasses of egg nog were half gone and all that was left of the cookies was just a few crumbs on the plate. 
“I had a lot of fun today. Thanks for playing with me in my first snowfall.” I say before finishing the rest of my egg nog. 
“I’m so glad you came to visit. You are always welcome here.” She smiles and rubbed my back. 
“Maybe we can do this every winter.” I mumbled before smiling and closing my eyes. ",A Michigan Winter
,"Kids, Fantasy, Lesbian","	It’s almost time for my midday break when my sister runs up to me, almost tripping in her oversized robe. Adelphie has to catch her breath, but whether it’s because of her excitement or the running I can’t tell. “Have you heard the news?”
	“What news?”
	A brown and white pigeon alights on her shoulder, carrying a scroll. “The prince is dead!”
	“The… wait, what?”
	“The prince is dead!”
	“Really? When? How do you know?” I reach towards the bird and Adelphie instinctively shrinks away, which hurts. Twenty years and she still doesn’t trust that I can control Assassin’s Gift. I’ve got half a mind to remind her if it wasn’t for my deadly talent, she wouldn’t even work in the palace—Bird-speakers like her come a copper a dozen—but if the prince is really dead, there are more pressing matters at hand. 
	“So the war is over?”
	“I mean, as much as there was still a war at all,” she says, but nods anyway. 
	The war is over. Huh. The war has been, in theory, going on for forty years, although it basically stopped in all but name ten years ago when the prince lost his allies in the south. And now, with his death, it’s officially all over. Huh. I sit back on my heels a little bit. I thought this occasion would be a little more… momentous. “Does everyone know?”
	“Not exactly.” Adelphie goes pink. “I sort of maybe intercepted the scroll because Rumble told me he thought it might be important.”
	Rumble must be one of her pigeons. I can’t ever keep all of their names straight. “You know that’s mail fraud, right? It’s definitely against the law.”
	Adelphie rolls her eyes. “You’re such a worry wort. Anyway, do you realize what this means?”
	“That the war is officially over?”
	“Well, yeah, duh, but you know what else it means?”
	“I guess not, no.”
	“You’re going to kill the princess!”
	
	It’s a few days until anything comes of my sister’s words. I act surprised when my supervisors tell me, in confidence, how the prince was slain near the rocky cliffs of Corundum, how his supporters have fled to the mountains, and I stand quietly next to the count and his family as they officially declare themselves the new royal family of our kingdom. They are met with thunderous applause. It is after the feast, after the raucous celebration in the streets, that the count’s daughter Ederra—Princess Ederra now, I suppose—approaches me. 
	“Remi.”
	“Princess Ederra,” I say and I curtsy low and deep to make her laugh. 
	I’m rewarded with a low giggle. “Stop that, it feels weird.” 
	“Everything feels weird now that it’s really over.”
	“Well, sort of. I mean, the war hasn’t been here in years, so most of it feels the same.” Her hair has started to fall out of the elaborate braided bun she’d worn it in during the festivities and tendrils of her thick black hair threaten to fall in front of her eyes. I tuck my own greasy hair behind my ear self-consciously when she smiles. 
	“Yeah, but now you guys are actually royals instead of just, you know, de facto royals. You’re a real princess now.”
	Ederra fixes me with her tar-black eyes. When she was younger, she was thought to be a Telepath because of that stare, but no. She’s just an intense person. Her real Gift is Temperature Manipulation, which I like to tell myself is why I always blush around her despite the fact that it's dead winter. 
	“Speaking of princesses,” she says tentatively, and I stifle a sigh. I wish we could have continued to talk outside of my royal duties. “There’s the matter of… of the old princess.”
	I know what Ederra wants, but I want her to say it. “Yes?”
	“We need you to…” Ederra struggles for tactful words and the air around us gets a little colder. “We need you to… perform a royal execution.” 
	“When?”
	“Tomorrow.” Ederra bites the inside of her cheek and she looks anywhere but my eyes for once. “At dawn.”
	I hate it when things are at dawn. Why do they always make things at dawn when they could be at any other time? “Alright. I’ll be there. Will you be in attendance?”
	Ederra glances up and I feel my cheeks go hot. Temperature Manipulation. “Would you like me to be there?”
	Yes. Absolutely. Execution has never gotten easier for me, no matter how often I’m made to do it. But, I reason, Ederra might see herself in the old princess. It would be hard to watch someone die for the crime of being born, especially when it’s the same crime Ederra herself is guilty of. I don’t want to do that to her. “No, that’s okay.”
	“Alright.” I can’t tell if Ederra looks disappointed or relieved. “You’ll join us for breakfast afterwards though, won’t you?”
	It always feels strange to eat breakfast so cheerily right after an execution, but I guess I’m lucky the royal family still wants to include me, now that the war is over. “Of course. I’ll be there.” I want to say something specific to her, about how I do anything for her, but her black eyes, like always, stop me in my tracks. “Of course,” I repeat, cursing my fear. “See you tomorrow.”
	
	Bolin wakes me up early—far earlier than I think is necessary. 
	“There’s still hours until dawn,” I grumble. 
	My brother shrugs. “So? Get up.”
	He busies himself getting ready while I begrudgingly pull on my boots. The royal executioner’s outfit is a heavy black cloak, so I don’t see the point in changing out of my bedclothes. It’s not like anyone is going to see them anyway. 
	“Why did you get up so early anyway?” 
	Bolin fastens a hat around his head. “Farming.”
	“Farming? It’s 
”
	He shrugs. “I’m loosening the earth, making sure the dirt isn’t frozen over. I don’t know, Jirka just told me to come over before dawn. I don’t ask questions.”
	“That’s stupid.”
	“No, it’s not.”
	“I hope you’re at least getting paid well.”
	Bolin won’t tell me what his wages are, so I assume I wouldn’t approve. Despite being an Earthshaker, blessed with the power of Earthquakes, my little brother is such a pushover.
	“Are you coming to the execution?”
	“I’ll try. Is Ederra coming?”
	“Probably not. I told her not to. I thought she might find it uncomfortable. But I’m seeing her afterwards, for breakfast.”
	Bolin’s eyebrows shoot up. “You two are actually going on a date?”
	“No, it’s with the entire royal family.”
	Bolin rolls his eyes. “And you think I’m a coward. How long has it been, Rem? Three years? Four?”
	“Shut up.”
	“You better get going. I’d walk with you, but I’m going east. I’ll see you at the execution.”
	“See you at the execution.”
	
	Despite the heavy black coat, I’m still cold when I step into the night. Its almost pitch black, but fairy lights mark the path, and besides, I’ve walked towards the royal dungeon so many times by now that I could do it in my sleep. 
	The snow crunches under my shoes and seeps into my socks. Ugh. Why couldn’t the war have ended in a summer month, when the celebration could last days and the warm summer night could be filled with laughter instead of the deathly cold silence that winter brings? At least in summer I can pretend I’m going to a nice job. Now, my heartbeat thrums in my frozen ears, reminding me that soon I will silence one of its own. 
	And my left foot is soaked. Super. I hate winter. 
	
	The guards nod solemnly when they see me and one of them—Eamon, I think—leads me to a section of the dungeon I’ve never been to before. I’ve given up talking to him—most of the royal staff doesn’t want to talk to someone with my abilities. He drops me off with a slight bow (I am, technically, his superior, I suppose) and leaves me in front of a heavy oak door that looks very out of place with the stone walls and floor. I reach into my pocket for my master key and have barely put it in the keyhole when a voice from inside says “It’s unlocked.”
	Gently, I press on the door and the voice is right; it swings open with a heavy groan. The inside is far more furbished than I am used to, with a nice little tea table and candles and a real bed instead of a cot. On the bed is a woman, probably around the age of my mother, who smiles at me. She must be the princess, I know, but I wasn’t expecting someone so… normal. Her brown hair, speckled with grey, lies loose around her shoulders instead of in the ornate braids and updos I’m used to with Ederra and her family, and her skin has been sallowed by lack of sunlight. Her smile is warm, though.  “Um. Hello.” She looks strangely familiar. 
	“Hello.” 
	At least she’s not crying. Lots of prisoners cry when they see me. Actually, come to think of it, she might have never seen this uniform before. “Do you… do you know who I am?”
	“You’re the royal executioner. I’ve been waiting for you.”
	This is not usual formula for these things. “You have? Did they tell you I was coming?”
	“No, not exactly. But usually my guards come to visit me a few times a day, and lately nobody has come at all. I figured they must be avoiding me.” She looks down at her feet. “I figured my—that the prince must have died or been killed.”
	“Yes. He died valiantly, protecting his troupes.” Small talk with the dying is always terrible. “I’m very sorry.”
	“It’s alright.” There’s a crack in her knees as she stands from her bed, and she smooths down her plain cotton dress. It’s going to get cold when we go outside—I wish I had a coat or something I could offer her. “Are we doing this here?”
	“No, I’m afraid. All royal executions are done in the front gardens, I’ve come to take you there.” She cringes away from the hand I offer her, which I suppose I can’t blame her for. 
	“That’ll be nice. My mother used to love the gardens, so I’d love to get to see them.”
	Usually the prisoners are in shackles, but the princess seems content to follow me and I feel fairly confident I could chase her down anyways. “Wait, what do you mean ‘get to see them’?”
	“I never have,” the princess confesses. “My mother always told me stories about how lovely the gardens were though.”
	“I thought you grew up in the palace. How have you never seen the gardens?” I have to slow my pace quite a bit for her, but it’s better than her trying to run away. 
	“I was born in the palace, but I grew up here. My mother and I were taken down into the dungeons when I was two, and I’ve lived here ever since.”
	“Oh.” That’s so sad. “I’m sorry. I’m… uh… glad you’ll be able to see them. Although it’s winter right now, all the plants are dead.” Wait, I think we’ve gone down this hall before. 
	“That’s alright.” The princess doesn’t look bothered by that fact. “What’s your name?”
	“My name?” Oh no, we’re definitely lost. “Eremiel.” 
	“What a pretty name.” She smiles at me. “My name is Thana.”
	Princess Thana. Not quite as catchy as Princess Ederra in my opinion, but pretty nonetheless. “Pleased to meet you. I have to tell you, you’re doing remarkably well with this. Far better than those I’ve met so far. You’re not even shackled.”
	The princess regards me with unnerving blue eyes. “I have spent the last thirty years waiting for my turn to die. My fear passed on long before I could follow.”
	I don’t really know how to take that, but at the very least I’m glad she’s not running away or bawling. I’m so awkward in those types of situations. In any case, I have absolutely no idea how to get out of the dungeon now. “If you don’t mind me asking, how did you know what my uniform was if you haven’t left in forty years?”
	“They haven’t changed it in thirty. When I was ten, my mother was taken from the dungeons by someone wearing a uniform just like yours. That was the last time I ever saw her, so… the image is pretty permanent in my mind.” 
	“Oh.” I had honestly forgotten about the old queen. “I’m sorry.”
	“It’s alright. I’m just relieved that when my time came, I got someone else.” Aw, that’s sweet, I’m someone else. “Are you related to him? The Assassin’s Gift is rare.”
	“No, actually. It came naturally.”
	“Really? How strange. What do your parents do?”
	It’s weird to have such a mundane conversation. Maybe she’s in shock. “They’re Animal-speakers, both of them. My sister is too. It’s just me and my little brother who got the recessive Gifts, I guess.”
	“Interesting. I’ve got a recessive Gift too. Everyone expected me to have Temper Spikes like my mother and brother.”
	I nod. The late princes’ Temper Spike Gift was legendary, and most of the reason the war persisted as long as it did. I’m not disappointed that the princess doesn’t have it though—I really don’t need her bursting into a spire of flame right now. “What is your Gift, if you don’t mind me asking?”
	I’m half expecting her to say ‘superspeed’ or something similar and take this ironic opportunity to escape, but instead the princess tells me “I’m a Dreamwarden.”
	“You’re a what?”
	“A Dreamwarden. It’s a rare Gift. Not as rare as yours, mind you. I walk in dreams. That’s partially why I wasn’t surprised when I saw you. You’ve got quite the nightmares.”
	
where I know her from then. “You’ve walked in my dreams?”
	“I’ve walked in the dreams of everyone in the palace. Have you heard of Queen Alaura?”
	“Uh, no?” I think I recognize that bit of wall there—and if I’m right, we are as far away from the dungeon entrance that we possibly could have been. Whoops. 
	“That’s my great grandmother.” Princess Thana’s pace slows. We haven’t been walking that long—surely she’s not tired. “She was renown throughout the kingdom for knowing every villager in the surrounding town because of her Gift.”
	Now that I know where we are, I can get us moving again. “So you inherited it from her?”
	“I suppose so. I think my son was one too.”
	“You had a son?” We’re almost there now, and once we’re out, it’ll only be five minutes or so until we get to the garden. I hope I haven’t missed dawn… that would be so embarrassing. “I thought you said you lived here your whole life.”
	“I did. I had my children here. It was years and years ago. My youngest would have been… a year or two older than you, maybe? But my son was my oldest, and I got to keep him the longest—I had him for two weeks before his father took him away. I could have sworn he was appearing in dreams by the looks the guards would give him.”
	“His father?” We’re almost there. 
	“One of the guards. My girls had the same father, and he took them away. Probably better that way.” 
	The question of what happened to them is on the tip of my tongue, but I stop myself from asking. Best case scenario, she doesn’t know. 
	Finally, we find the opening to the dungeon and I lead the old princess into the open air. Two more guards silently flank us as we walk away from the dungeon. “Sorry it’s so cold out. You can borrow my boots, if you like.”
	The princess is silent—her fate must have finally sunk in. 
	“If only the war had ended in summer,” I say, half joking. “You could’ve seen the flowers. I wish I could have given you a better last day. A prettier one.”
	Princess Thana does not reply, so I turn to her and find that she’s crying. I suppose I can’t blame her—I am her executioner, after all. She bends, putting her hands on her knees to aid her atrophied legs, and kneels in the snow, letting it melt in her hands. 
	“Snow,” she says, not looking up, and I can’t tell if it’s a question or just a comment. 
	“Uh, yeah.”
	“I’ve never seen snow. I knew what it was, of course, but I’d never before…” The old princess makes it back up to her feet.
	“Like I said, I’m sorry it could be summer so it’d be pretty out.”
	“What are you talking about?” Princess Thana stands up straight, looking out towards the palace at the vast field of snow, and for a second her face is ageless and she is a child again, a child who has never seen snow or winter or made a snowman or hit her brother in the face with a snowball. “This place… this place is wonderful.”
	Although I've always hated winter and we’re already late, I relent a little bit. “If you think that’s great, just wait a moment.”
	The princess turns to me. “Why? What’s happening in a moment?”
	I point to the east, where dawn has started to paint the horizon in shades of pink and purple, casting hues onto the driven snow. 
	“You’re already late,” one of the guards whispers in my ear, and I know that. But watching the old princess revel in winter’s beauty, I can’t bear to move her any faster. 
	When she turns to me again, her face is soaked in tears. “Thank you,” she says, as if I had painted the sky myself. “I never… I never got to see winter before, except in dreams. It’s a miracle, isn’t it? Isn’t it all? I waited forty years for this sight.” Without warning, she grabs my hands. “Don’t wait. Don’t you wait. You are young and you are free. Live well, live broadly, live for moments like these. Live, my dear.”
	
	Her death is uneventful. I tell her to close her eyes, and she obliges. I lay my hand on her heart and then its over. I announce her name to the king, and her body is taken from the frozen garden. I stay though, longer than everyone else, long enough to miss breakfast and soak my socks a second time. 
	“Where were you? You said you’d come to breakfast.” Ederra’s voice doesn’t startle me. “Was this one harder for you?”
	“No, it’s not that,” I say, although it definitely was. “I guess I just… I never noticed how beautiful the garden is in the winter.”
	“You hate the winter.”
	That was true but because of the old princess, I felt as if I was seeing it for the first time. Ederra too. “Hey, do you want to have a picnic with me? For lunch? Out here?”
	Ederra’s eyes open wide in shock and the snow under her feet melts. “What?”
	“You and me. Together, out here. In the garden.” 
	“I would—what brought this on—I—” 
	“It just seemed like the right moment.” I reach out my hand towards her and she doesn’t shrink away. “It’s such a beautiful winter day—I don’t know if we’ll ever see another. Better take advantage of this winter, shouldn’t we?”
	She takes my hand, and I’m twenty years old, but this is the first winter I’ve ever seen. ",A Royal Execution

	",The First Winter
,Kids,"It was a cold January night. Well, of course it was cold, it was snowing. It would be surprising if it were snowing and it 
 cold.
     I stood on my porch with my beautiful wife in my arm. She was wearing her fuzzy purple robe she loved. We were watching our two kids, Jolei and Summit. Yes, we're that white couple who gives ""original"" names to our kids. Jolei and Summit were experiencing their first winter snow. My wife and I were hoping that it would have snowed before Christmas, but this was good, too. We're just glad it snowed.
     Jolei grabbed a handful of snow and pounded it into a ball. She threw the snowball at her brother, which triggered a war. Summit tried to throw a snowball back in retaliation, but missed and hit me. The kids laughed.
     ""Oh, you think this is funny?"" I asked, brushing the snow off my clothes. ""I'll show 
 what's funny!""
---
After a little while, Melissa, my wife, got too cold which meant it was time for everyone to go back inside. We walked back in and I started preparing some hot cocoa to bring our bodies to a comfortable temperature.
     ""Dad,"" Summit looked up to me as I handed him his mug. ""What was 
 first winter snow like?""
     I paused before handing out everyone else's mugs. I had told Melissa this story, but I was just realizing I hadn't told the kids this story. I sat down in my chair and turned towards my kids.
     ""When I was a kid - a little bit younger than you, Jolei - I got sick.""
     ""How old were you?"" Jolei asked.
     My son was 10 at the time, and my daughter had just turned 7 at the end of December.
     ""I was five,"" I answered. ""I was nine before I was able to go home. I was really sick. You see, I had cancer. I don't know if either of you know what that is: It's a sickness people can get sometimes that takes a long time to get rid of. The doctors were able to get rid of it a few times, but it kept coming back. That's why it took so long.""
     ""So when did you get to see snow?"" Summit asked.
     ""I was 9 when I finally got to see snow,"" I said. ""I was 8 when I got out of the hospital, but that was during the summer.""
     ""Tell that what it was like, sweetie,"" Melissa said.
     The memories started flooding back to me. All I could remember before then was the hospital room. Everything about the snow was a new experience for me. I had never been so cold. I loved it. I had never seen such a vastness of the color white - even the walls of the hospital weren't as white as the snow. Everything was new and I fell in love with it all the instant I experienced it. I must have made about 100 snow angels. I then ran to my backyard and made a snowman family. The mom, the dad and three kids - just like my family.
     I told my kids everything, sparing no detail. The kids, who were normally very chatty, listened to every word without interruption. I was blinded from the lights reflecting off my wife's teeth, her smile was so big. I went on for what seemed like hours until I couldn't say anything else about that night. I remembered like it was the night before. It was as if I was still a kid and I had just come back inside from making those snowmen. I took my first sip of my hot cocoa - it was cold.
     Melissa wiped a tear from her eye. ""I never heard the story like that,"" she said, her voice trembling with emotion. ""That was beautiful.""
     I smiled at her and looked at my kids. I know Thanksgiving is in November, but I was feeling mighty thankful in that moment. I love my family. I'm glad my kids got to experience their first snow, I'm glad I was there to witness it, I'm glad to have my family and I'm looking forward to experiencing many more winter snows with this group of people. My favorite people.",A Father's First Snow
,Kids,"“Hey sweetie, wake up. Come and look outside.” Kate gently tried to wake 5-year-old Ariana who was sleeping cocooned in a fluffy blanket.
She stirred after a pause, muttering incoherently. A slimy track of drool had made its way from the corner of her mouth to her chin. Katie tutted, took a couple of tissue paper from the nightstand and wiped it off. Ariana’s eyelashes fluttered.
“I know you are awake, young lady.” Katie said in a stern voice, “enough with the theatrics.”
Ariana giggled and sat up, brushing aside her hair. “Mom, what’s 
?” She asked, having difficulty in pronouncing the word. 
“Being dramatic.”
Ariana frowned, looking at her blanket. She seemed to be in deep thought as she tried to process what being dramatic had to do with her waking up. Seeing this, Katie smiled, “Aren’t you going to ask me why I woke you up early?”
“Why did you wake me?”
“It’s snowing!”
“What’s that?” 
“I will show you. But you must get your warm clothes on. It’s cold outside. You will get sick.” Ariana got out of bed and started to put her gloves, hat, coat, socks and boots with assistance from her mom. After finishing, they walked outside to the living room where a large window opened to the lawn. The ground was currently covered in snow and more of it was falling from the grey sky—light and gentle. Ariana gasped and ran outside, jumping on the tips of her toes in the snow. 
“Mom, is this snow? I love it! It’s so soft!” Ariana declared, scooping fistfuls of snow and throwing them upwards so they came floating down to finally settle on her hair and clothes.
“Let’s make snow angels.” 
“We can make snow angels! Wow! Do you think they will let me try their wings?” 
“Not really. But we can use our arms to fly.”
Ariana’s eyes bulged with excitement.
“Copy what I do.” Katie said, laying down in the snow and starting to move her arms up and down and her legs back and forth. 
Ariana took the same position and started to clumsily move her limbs, copying her mother. She looked at the sky with squinted eyes as snowflakes brushed her face. She opened her mouth, sticking out her tongue and tried to catch snowflakes.
“Do it a little faster now!” Katie instructed, picking up speed. Ariana did the same, moving her limbs quickly. Even though she was still on the ground, she could pretend she was flying. And this certainly felt a lot like flying to her. Her mom really knew the solution to every problem.
“We are flying, honey! Move your arms and legs faster so we can do some loop de loops in the air. But be careful, don’t get too close to the sun. HIP HIP!” 
Ariana moved her limbs faster than before, giggling, pure joy spilling out of her. 
“HURRAY!”
“Look, I spot some angels.” Katie exclaimed, pointing at the sky, “Let’s call for them. Ahoy! AHOY ANGELS!”
“Ahoy!!” Ariana cried out.
“Oh no! We have lost them. That’s okay. I know something else that attracts angels.” 
“You do! Tell me!” Ariana sat up speedily at this revelation and looked at her mother in wonder. Katie sat up too and leaned towards her daughter. Ariana sensed the secrecy and felt proud that her mom would trust her with a secret as divine as this. The air between them grew tense, the silence pulsing with the electricity of anticipation. 
“A snowman!” Katie whispered, finally spilling the secret. It passed between them like a living, breathing entity. Ariana looked at her mom with stars in her eyes.
“Wow.” She whispered with a content sigh. 
“Let’s make one, shall we?” Katie said, standing up and offering Ariana her hand.
“Wait! I thought they were real people!” Ariana pouted, took her mom’s hand and stood up. 
“Oh, but they are. Why on Earth shouldn’t they be real?!” 
“Let’s make one then!” Ariana exclaimed, high spirits and faith in magic restored. 
“That’s the spirit! Come on! Bring some clothes for the snowman. I will start making its body.”
“Okay!” 
With that, Ariana raced inside to do some scavenger hunting while her mom gathered piles of snow in one place using a shovel from the shed in the corner of the lawn. 
In no time, Ariana was back, her cheeks and nose flushed and her face glowing. She dumped the clothes near the window leading inside and started to help her mother by scooping fistfuls of snow and piling it up while her mom gave the snowman its round shape that it was so well known for. 
It took 3 hours of hard work to finish the snowman. Ariana took two pebbles and a carrot to make the snowman's eyes and nose. She took the clothes she had brought and clothed the snowman in them.
“Yay! We did it!” Ariana cried out, high-fiving her mother. 
“Yes, we did. Now we have to wait for the angels to get here.” Katie said, patting Ariana’s head. The latter squealed and clasped her hands together, “I can’t wait! I want to thank them for the good things they do.”
“That’s kind of you, honey. They will love how thoughtful you are.” 
Ariana beamed.
“We can make s’mores while we wait for them.”
“
” Ariana asked, trying to pronounce it the way her mom had.
Katie smiled, “Yes! S’mores. No ‘a’ in it. S’mores.” 
“S’MORES! But what are they?”
“They are a special treat that Santa eats at the North Pole himself.” 
“Let’s make them then!” 
“Let’s go inside first and get the supplies. Then we will go make a fire in the fire pit.” 
They both stepped inside. Katie went into the kitchen and started to gather what would be needed to make ‘Santa’s special treat’. From the kitchen, she heard her daugh2ter saying s’mores over and over. She was rolling the ‘r’ each time trying to magic the flavor of the treat out of thin air and taste it on her tongue. 
Katie smiled, an ache in her heart. A good ache. She felt so thankful for her daughter. Despite the initial difficulties after having Ariana, she had fought, survived and look where they were now. In a warm, welcoming house celebrating their first (snowy) winter. They had initially lived in Hawaii where the sun would beat down on them every day. In winter there was hardly any change except on the mountain peaks. But they hadn’t had any experience of winters on the Hawaiian mountain tops as circumstances had kept them confined to the low grounds. 
Brushing her thoughts aside, Katie went outside to find Ariana sitting by the window. Her face was pressed to the glass, watching out for incoming angels. 
“Ari dear, come on outside.” 
Ariana turned away and followed her mom out to the fire pit on the veranda located on the side of the house. The 5-year-old had started chanting s’mores again in excitement. 
5 minutes later, Ariana was looking in awe at the fire that her mom had conjured out of thin air. She looked admiringly at her mother. 
Katie passed a stick with a marshmallow stuck on top to Ariana and made one for herself. She then showed Ariana how to rotate the stick so the fire wouldn’t burn the marshmallow. Ariana burned the first few but eventually got the hang of it after which her mom demonstrated how to make the s’mores. There were giggles and laughter as they roasted marshmallows and assembled them with chocolate and graham crackers, eating them one after another. 
Soon they had wiped out everything and they were sitting next to each other in a comfortable silence looking at the stars starting to peek out as night fell. The fire had burned out, leaving behind a few glowing, red-hot embers. 
Ariana had started snoring, her head on Katie’s lap. It grew too cold to sit outside so Katie gently moved Ariana’s head aside. She stood up and took her daughter in her arms. She went inside and tucked her in her bed. 
Katie had always tried her best to keep the magic of life alive for her daughter and she herself had learned so much from Ariana. She had learned how charming a child’s inquisitiveness and curiosity was and how much wonder they showed while learning about new things. But the most important thing Ariana had taught her was that one should keep their childlike wonder in adulthood too. Because life was certainly sweet and happy if one enjoyed and took pleasure in the little things that life had to offer. ",Wonder
,Kids,"When I was younger, in my teens, growing up in Florida I would spend my winters ( if you could call them that) running around outside in gym shorts and hoodies. The only places I had ever seen snow was on the television. Seeing snow, watching and feeling it actually fall from the sky was at the top of my bucket list. However, if you would have told me my first encounter with the frozen rain would be courtesy of the U.S. Army making my first station a base 5,000 miles away from home in Alaska I would have taken that dream balled it up, sailed it personally to the Bermuda Triangle and tossed it overboard in hopes that it would disappear just like the thousands of ships talked about in tales.
“What the hell T, I told you enlisting was a bad idea, first boot camp and now they are shipping your dumbass clear across the world. No, tell them no!”
That was the reaction of my best friend Gigi, she doesn’t sugar coat anything or handle change very well clearly but the fact that she always keeps it real with me is why we get along so well, not to many people will tell you about yourself and not have a lick of remorse doing it. Maybe Gigi was right, maybe me enlisting was a bad idea but that didn’t matter much because for the next 3 years at least Uncle Sam owned me. If I was being honest I was considering making a career of it but I wouldn’t tell her that, not today anyway she was already mad enough at me.
“Gigi look it is what it is and hey just think now you have an excuse to get your lazy butt out of Florida to come visit me. We always talked about traveling and seeing the world” I said.
Well this isn’t exactly what I had in mind but I guess your right. I still think it’s stupid though,” she replied.
“ I love you too,” I answered back while not so gently elbowing her in her side. 
I knew Gigi didn’t feel like she would get the chance to visit me and that is really what had her all upset. Gigi and me we were cut from the same cloth, both grew up in families that barely made enough to pay the bills and put food on the table and we learned early on that struggle was not a temporary situation but a way of life and now we were carrying on that tradition but not me I was determined to be more, do more and the military was chance to do that…my way out.If surviving the unknown frozen tundra they call Alaska was the price I had to pay to prove how committed I was to something better I was all in. And as soon and I got myself together I was going to fly Gigi out so she could see there was more to the world then the same 10 blocks we had run all our lives.
Right now I had to put on my happy face so she wouldn’t worry about me, well wouldn’t worry to much at least and we could make the best of my short time home. It felt like I had just gotten back as I waited in the airport a week later to get on my flight to the place I would call home for the next 3 yrs. 
I arrived at the end of summer so it wasn’t to cold yet but the sun never fully set which was just weird but I have to admit it wasn’t to bad I was just a little homesick. So I acclimated , worked hard and prepared myself for my “first winter”. Gradually the days grew colder. I think the first day the thermostat hit negative temps was when I realized that this was it. I was a long way from home and snow was clearly overrated. I felt deceived by all those smiling faces on sled and skis I had seen on the t.v. I cursed every snow ball fight that the movies made look joyful and fun. I resigned myself to life in doors as much as possible, appreciating fully thawed fingers and toes. Sure I got in some laughs catching the guys in my unit with an unexpected rogue snowball (that I would never claim even if caught red handed) from time to time. 
I received my fair share of perfectly timed anonymously delivered snow cannons and believe me when I tell you there is nothing more traumatic then falling victim to a rogue snowball to the base of your neck, which then proceeds to melt and slide like ice cold pins of torment down your back. Yea I know karma and all that but whatever. 
I texted often to tell Gigi about winter in Alaska and even though I may have complained a lot I know she could tell I was okay and doing well and that was all that mattered. The first time it snowed this is how our conversation went.
“Hey bighead guess what?
“What stupid?”
“It snowed today, but it was so freakin cold outside I literally went outside touched it and then came back in, lol. Snow is overrated.”
“What?? You are so whack I’m going to need you to man up and go outside and build a snowman and send pics”
“Uhh that’s not going to happen but when you come visit I will gladly watch from my window as you build us a snowman.”
That was followed by a slew of cutting sarcastic comments that almost made me feel like I was home. 
Gigi didn’t come visit that first winter but she was able to come the following year and it was her first and our “first winter” together. And she made me go outside and build a damn snowman.
We both had a good laugh over thinking God or the Universe or whoever is pulling the strings has one messed up sense of humor. ",Alaskan Winter
,Kids,"I'm finding it hard to admit these days, and I know everyone says to do so with grace, but I still feel nineteen in my head. I am old. I am in my own winter of life. It terrifies me and torments me, but I am in my winter. I watched parents and grandparents and celebrities around me grow old and wither away in their wheelchairs and their oatmeal dinners, but just as you don't realise the tide coming in on a beach, it is suddenly upon me now - it's my turn for the overboiled broccoli and the assisted living. My turn for the 'senior moments' and the pity. 
Ironically, as I come into my own winter, snow falls outside as the earth comes into another of her's. The coldness creeps slowly, knotting my knuckles and making my knees sore. I used to love the snow; I'd go out and about, playing and laughing - I never spared a thought for the elderly who were afraid to go outside, cautious that they might fall and not get back up. As I look through my window, I see young people walking around in the street, the occasional snowball pelted one way or the other. It's like watching ghosts of myself. Imagine at the end of your life, you were given a big movie of all the moments you went through on your journeys. That's how it feels, in a way. I am a fly on the wall, watching other people grow as I did and seeing myself in them all. 
There seems to be a whirlwind of feelings within this feeling of aging. Some days, I look in the mirror and see all of my adventures reflecting in my eyes, the laughter lines framing my face, and I feel proud of the past. But other days, I can't help but notice the paleness in my eyes, the slight yellow tinge. The sagginess of my skin where it was once soft and pert. I feel as though the young me is still in there somewhere, underneath the arthiritis and the wrinkles. Somewhere. I once had a corckscrew of brilliant blonde hair, where now a limp crop of white wisps hangs. 
It isn't all doom and gloom, though, to be old. It feels eventual - technically, my whole life has pointed towards this chapter. I have achieved a long life, and although it may no longer be the life I once had and cherished, it has been a life of happiness and warmth. In this, my penultimate stage, I feel a period of reflection is very appropriate. What else is there to do? Like an author, almost, I have written my story and now I can sit back with accomplishment.
I feel a sort of affinity with the winter months now, when the crops and the blooms are gone and the country is left barren and sleepy. I get some visits from my children and their children sometimes, but I'm not overly concerned nor offended when a little more time passes between visits. They are living their lives in the full bloom stage, their children in spring. All of them have work to do and paths to carve out. This is my time now to let the worries of life pass me by, as none of them are applicable to me anymore. My hard work through the years as a barrister has left me a handsome pension, my home of forty years is paid off and left with me, my husband is dead and buried and I, alone, yes, but rather contented, am left to my own devices. I recall my twenties, where I wished for money and love and security, and I feel satisfied that she got her wish. I am reaping the benefits of my spring and summer. It sometimes feels like I have been left the empty carcass of a chicken at a picnic, but rationally I know that all of the succulent tender breast was all mine throughout my life. 
I like to write my thoughts down, like this, on days when my hands aren't as sore. It is lovely to be able to write from a reflective point of view. No more do I fantasise about fiction novels, as it came to my attention recently that my memories are far more interesting than any fantasy land. Writing keeps me anchored in the here and now. It is terrifying when the consciousness seems to sap from me, when I am stood not knowing how or when I came to a place. Almost as if I have become another's possession, an autonomy project, moving me about without my knowing. Nothing is an easy task anymore, and I feel my cognitive processes slow with age. The full-on brainwork I undertook in my job would be impossible to me now. Hell, when I make a cup of tea these days I have to stand and wonder what order the components go into the mug, even what the ingredients may be. I have made a few 'senior' mistakes now. My biggest was when I accused my daughter, Harriet, of stealing my inhaler. My, how I screamed and pointed these gnarly fingers. Embarrassingly, I had put it in the freezer a few hours before. It feels very strange to become aware that I had done these kind of things - where was I when they happened? I certainly wasn't present in myself. It makes me wonder what else I could possibly be getting up to when I lose myself. Makes me question myself - even , to the extent, am I here now? Is this me? 
With winter, comes death, but after that, new life. I am not afraid to die. A bold statement, I know. When I was full of life, it frightened me, but now that I have lived my life and fulfilled my dreams and pursued my goals, I accept that death is the next metamorphasis for me. Life goes on, with or without me sitting in my armchair. I do hope it will be peaceful, though. I feel a comfort in knowing that the reaper will, relatively soon, set up camp on my doorstep. She will be my final companion, I suppose. If there is nothing, then so be it - at least if there is nothing, I will feel nothing. There won't be pain or fear or coldness, just plain, neverending nothingness. A vacuum. I wish I could write about it as it happens, just to let you know, as a sort of conversation. I think that would be very comforting. I do find the way no one is happy to talk about eventualities rather comical. Euphemisms galore, like ""pass away"" or ""go"", bring a crass smirk to my face. When it stares you in the face, it seems bizarre to call death anything but Death. 
Anyway, that is my experience of my first winter. Of course, we all get only one winter. I am glad to be experiencing mine in comfort and relative wellness, when so many others wither away in institutions, rather a lot like waiting rooms for their eventual end. I don't want to die, but that doesn't mean I don't welcome it. There is a time for everyone. And now that the snow falls and my branches are bare, I offer no fruit to anyone else. May I quietly slip away into softness of winter. ",Walking in My Winter
,Kids,"Laura, a 6 year old girl was playing in her room with fake clouds. The fake cloud she made, was her drawing. She added some smoke by burning some wood.
'What is she doing?', Laura's new drawing teacher asked. Laura's mother Camilla replied ' she loves clouds, i told her what clouds are and what it looks like, She loved it'. The teacher asked 'what are you saying, can't she see real clouds outside?, why playing with the fake ones?'.
Camilla told the teacher about Laura's disease. Laura was allergic to outside, from her childhood she can't tolerate the weather outside, she had so many skin diseases. That's why Camilla never took Laura outside, Laura's room had no windows. Even Laura doesn't knew that there are real clouds and she could go outside.
The teacher said ' she can't spend her entire life like this, you have to take her outside, see the doctor or do a treatment. Laura is normal like other child, she has every right to know about everything. Eventually when she will grow up, you have to tell her. So tell her now'.
Camilla replied ' you know i have to protect her, i cant do this.' Camilla's face looked pale after saying those words, she was about to cry but somehow she held her tears.
Winter season was knocking at everyone's door. Laura was watching her favorite cartoon show 'Pokemon'. Camilla thought she could buy a gift for Laura. Camilla made an excuse to go outside, she told Laura she was about to take a nap and it will not take long.
Camilla opened the back door slowly, but by mistake for the first time she forgot to lock the door. She never does that, this was her first huge mistake that could go horribly wrong. Laura was told that it was not a door, it was the end of their area, she could not go any further.
Laura was bored, she was walking around and suddenly she noticed the door was unlocked, even her mother told her it was not a door, she wanted to see if it really wasn't a door. She came close and she opened the door. The door was finally opened.
No one knew what was about to happened to Laura, she could die, she could fell ill, anything could happened.
As Laura opened the door, a cold breeze touched her skin, the winter wind felt like heaven to her. Laura never felt that good before. To her it was like she entered into some kind of other dimension. She stepped out of her house, touched the trees, touched the ground. She began to run and fell into the pond,she thought it was some kind of big bowl which had cold water. She began to swim, but she never learned swimming. There were other people just like her, she talked to them. She looked at the sky and saw the same thing like clouds, she was confused, she thought which one she should call cloud, the outside one is far more beautiful than anything. Laura knew about everything but the fake ones, the trees, the clouds, the sun. Laura decided the outside was better than anything. She liked it more. That day she promised herself she will only play outside the house, she was excited, she experienced her first winter without even realizing it . She ran towards the house to tell her mother about this, but suddenly she fell on the ground and she fainted.
Laura opened her eyes and saw her mother, she cried and wanted to tell her everything. Laura noticed she was laying in the bed.
Camilla asked Laura ' why you were sleeping in the sofa my dear?'. Laura was shocked and wanted to explain. But she thought it could be a dream, it's not real. Laura never told anything about the incident to anyone. She sometimes tried to open doors but it was locked every time.
It was very strange and confusing for Laura, but after 2 days she realized it was not a dream, she fell that day and got hurt. She checked her foot and she had a wound. Laura was finally sure and happy but she never told her mother and stayed quiet. She knew her mother had reasons about this matter, she loved her mother more than anything else and supported her always. But her experience was great and that was the happiest day in her life, she didn't knew she had celebrated her first winter.",HAPPIEST WINTER
,Kids,"Smog diluted the orange lights, giving them an eerie tint. The motor-coach rattled over the uneven stones, alone in the reaches of the night. From far away came the singing of drunks, riding erratic eddies of the wind.
It is dark, and Thaddeus Grey watches the moon.
He has never considered himself a man of mystery, for the very simple reason that men of mystery tend to know what it is that they're doing, and to an extent, why. Eccentricity, he has long ago decided, requires a good amount of sanity to count for anything. Else you're just a schmuck. 
The coach came to a stop. As it has always been in Ans, this required an excessive amount of bumps and trundling gasps of smoke, which rattled him from his reverie. With a start, he grabbed at a handle inset near the door, and glanced at the seat next to him. She had not stirred. Good.
He rapped against a small divide between himself and the driver, and the curtain rustled in answer.
""Not too rough, was it? It's these rocks they use... damn useless for the horses, too, so I'd say we got off lucky.""
""Drop us off near the concourse,"" said Thaddeus. ""I can make my way from there."" 
There was the barest suggestion of a nod, and the curtain fell back into place. Wincing at the jarring motion, Thaddeus moved back into his seat, checked the package one more time, and frowned at the square that was coming into view. 
At this hour, it was justifiably abandoned. The air, adhering itself to oddly shaped curls and eddies, seemed to whisper against him. Nonsense verses, like the taste of a woman's hair. He tugged on his gloves. They were shorter than the norm, and covered him only to the upper wrist. He knocked the back of the seat again.
""Why is it that wizards wear such incredibly long boots?""
Silence persisted for a few long seconds. Finally, he said, ""Concourse is coming up. Looks empty.""
""Yes, well, it would be."" He rustled at his pockets, and drew out a small cigarette. ""It's late, after all. But don't you worry. Langley will be here.""
""Still kicking, is he? Heard he died two years ago, fell outta the dome.""
""Well, you know what they say about very old men..."" He let the suggestion float in the air, until his companion took the bait, albeit with an indulgent sigh.
""What's that, then?""
The car trundled to a stop once more, juggling the words in Thaddeus' throat until at last it came to a standstill. He pushed open the door, flung the package over one shoulder, and flashed a brilliant smile at his driver. ""They 
""
""There's a lantern on the side, there,"" said the voice from inside the coach. ""Careful not to fall. Stones are slick in the fog.""
""Not my first time around. Take care, Hanson.""
Hanson gave him a small salute. Thaddeus watched him go, waving as he turned a corner. When the last lights disappeared from view, he changed the girl's position on his shoulder, and smiled. ""Good man, that,"" he told her. ""Not many of them around these days, or so they say.""
No reply, but that was to be expected. The sedative had smelled expensive. Before them, rising between the weak illumination of two streetlamps like a king above his subjects, the Observatory of Listarel commanded the sickly mists. 
""Always hated these lamps,"" he said, as he headed for the heavy doors. ""They have these lights in Sterl, you, know, that glow blue when you switch them on. Very cheerful blue."" He knocked once, twice, then twice more, quickly, on a knocker designed with a pattern of stars, arranged in an arch. ""They call it Glint,"" he confided in her, as the portal swung open on silent hinges. Beyond, the lobby was deserted. And dark.
In those days, the Observatory played not-so-very-humble-host to the last great work of the artist Reneuoe. The chandelier was his masterpiece, a veritable castle of grand crystal and yellow diamonds that seemed to dance in slow patterns when you watched them for long enough. There were platforms near the roof, specifically installed for guests to ogle at the mastery of the metalwork of the candelabras, the glow of the flames and the delicate mirrors that whirled their humble light into veritable majesty. It wasn't just good craftsmanship. It was a work worthy of the gods.  
... And tonight, no one had gone to the trouble to light it. It was nearly lost to view, somewhere up there, where the stairs curled into an invisible eternity, where not even the stars were shining ...
""Shall we pull up a bed for you?"" asked a voice. Thaddeus turned.
""Langley. Good to see you're still alive.""
""The dome's not as tall as it looks,"" said Langley. He was hunched over a small hooded lantern, with which he led Thaddeus into a side room, through a narrow series of halls. 
""Not meeting in the observatory, then?""
""Too open,"" said Langley. He seemed to be looking for something. His hands searched about the doors, feeling, Thaddeus knew, for a very specific pattern of fairies doing questionable things to a donkey. ""Here,"" came the whisper, followed by a sharp 
, and a ponderous grinding of gears. An opening appeared between the two doors, into a very short hall. At the end was another door.
""Very nice. Impressive every time.""
""How very nice that you are happy, Mr. Grey."" Alaborius Langley was one of those men who has grown old enough, and wise enough, that his glance tended to make you feel very small. Even Thaddeus, who considered himself inured to such nonsense, felt some small shred of resolve within him burn into ash. ""Things on our end are not as cheerful as you may remember.""
""A blood cult? Unhappy? My word, Langley... will you never cease to surprise me?""
""You seek to irritate me.""
""Well, that's unfair,"" Thaddeus followed the old priest into the room, and heard the door scrape closed behind him. ""I just want to know what's going on."" He peered around a stack of books with black covers and red stamps across the spines. ""Where's Borovin?""
""I believe we're taking this by the usual routine.""
""Dead, then.""
""Very creatively so. We found his ear hanging on the Parthic Gate.""
""Nailed?""
""Knotted,"" said Langley, and took a seat by the room's main furnishing: a raised platform inscribed with an eleven-pointed star. ""They used his intestines as rope.""
There was silence for a while. One got the feeling that there ought to be a fire, crackling in the background. There was only silence.
""Well,"" said Thaddeus, after a pause. ""That's certainly... novel. And... the rest of him?""
""Pending,"" scowled Langley. He pointed at the girl. ""You can set her down, now.""
""What, on the star?""
Langley waved his hand dismissively. ""No. Not yet. Put her on that carpet, over there. That'll do.""
The two men watched her for a while. Thaddeus raised an eyebrow. He was very good at that. He practiced.
""Peaceful creature,"" he said.
""Odd, certainly,"" replied Langley. ""The people of Nakafar do not have winter, did you know? Too near the rotation. They count seasons by the tide."" Thaddeus puffed his cigarette. In the poor ventilation of the room, the smoke made little clouds that twisted, dreamlike, through the air. ""But now,"" Langley continued, ""you must also have heard of the men of the Galetops... they have no summer. Their springs are when they raise their young, and winters are where they prove their worth as men.""
""What's your point?""
""In her homelands, this is a woman of 35. Here, she is 14. In the Galetops... an infant comes into the world.""
Thaddeus laughed. ""That's almost ridiculous enough to have come from 
Langley."" He smothered the cigarette on one of the shelves. ""You know what I'm wondering.""
""You've never been one for morals.""
""True,"" said Thaddeus. He shrugged. ""But this is something else entirely, isn't it?""
""Oh, certainly.""
""So, then. What do we do now? Just... stab her?""
Langley looked at him, long and slow. ""Not precisely."" He walked over to one side of the room, to a dusty old chest sagging against the wall. Odd scores raked along the wood, and Langley drew out from its depths a package, swaddled in beige cloth. 
Thaddeus sighed. He'd had enough jobs, now, to know what the old man meant. ""Once more unto the breach,"" he murmured. 
""Indeed."" The smile was fleeting, but sympathetic. ""Go by the Silver Bridge. Head north."" A small bell interrupted the directions. It was strung against a wall, and its clapper had been hollowed to enhance but thin the sound. The two men turned as one.
""Hall?""
""Someone's opened the passage,"" said Langley.
""Trade secret, I thought?""
""Borovin. They must've beaten it out of him."" Langley strode, stooped but powerful, to the door, and casually knocked over a bookcase, creating a crude barricade moments before something heavy thudded against it. 
""That can't be the only exit, can it?""
There was no reply. Langley was pulling at the raised platform, and Thaddeus moved to help him. There was the scraping of wood, another thud against the door. The star was moved. 
A ladder, falling into shadows and flinty darkness.
There was a whisper at the door.
""
said a voice, low and cutting. ""
Thaddeus grabbed his revolver. Langley placed a hand over his own. 
""No.""
""Don't be so dramatic. I'll pump it with lead, you can wait at the bottom.""
""Take the girl."" His voice was clenched, perspiration dotted his wild white hair and stained his astronomer's cap. 
Silence from the door. Thaddeus drew his hand slowly away, and flashed Langley a smile.
""See? There we are. It's go""-
A humming filled the small space. It was most visible in the smoke, which seemed to curl within itself, like worms in thrashing agony. The air was sucked 
caving through the flimsy wood of the door. Blue symbols flashed for a moment against the borders, first in anger, then desperation, and then the splinters shattered and spread into a mass of fractal mulch, shooting through the bookcase, throwing it against the other wall. 
Darkness filled the room. 
""
""
""
He couldn't help it. In a second, the revolver was in his hand. In another, three bullets of bright steel went sailing into the shadows. There was no impact. There was only silence, then a face, emerging as if from a pond. 
Thaddeus saw a pair of eyes, as empty as life, as full of life, as the halo of dead stars. The head was pale, and bald, and scars crossed the nose and lips and turned them to ragged, hanging flesh. 
""
""What...""
Another hum, and a halting series of alien notes, and now a slice of oblivion, embodied in a spreading mass of black lightning that shot across the room, screamed as it traversed the room. He grabbed the girl, and dived. Somewhere above came a horrible cry, and as he landed very heavily on the stone far below, trickles of red flowed down around his head.
Above, a shadow blocked the light of the room. He fired wildly, heard the bullets sing against the ladder and the shadow disappeared. 
Nothing more was needed. 
He ran.",Concerning Lambs
,Kids,"It was almost studying time. Momma made me sit and read these things called encyclopedias at least once a day. I grabbed my stuffie, Clunk, and pulled him close. His raggedy ears started tickling my face like they always do. Momma told me that he was what was called a rabbit. She had even shown me pictures of rabbits in one of the encyclopedias one time, and they looked so small and cuddly. I want to see one for real, but that was never going to happen. Momma says that they likely don’t exist anymore. She says there is probably nothing on the surface anymore. Momma, Daddy, and I live underground. Daddy built this place for us to be safe. 
Momma says the air on the surface is poison. She said that a long time before I was born, some grownups weren’t getting along, and they threw something called atom bombs at each other. I don’t know what those are, but they killed a bunch of people. That’s why the air is full of poison, and we have to live here, under the ground. My picture books have some photos of what things used to look like on the surface. Everything looked so green and pretty. Our house is just a dreary gray. I wish I could see all the colors that used to exist. 
“Katie!” My daddy was in the next room calling for Momma; I wasn’t allowed in there. It wasn’t safe, or so they would tell me all the time, “Katie, come here.”
“Coming, Hun,” Momma called out to him, she was cleaning her hands in the kitchen where she was cooking lunch. She patted my head as she passed me. “Clean up your toys, Peach. It’s almost time to eat. After that, you know that it is study time.” With that, she entered the other room. I could hear their voices faintly, and Daddy’s voice seemed excited. I edged towards the door, straining to make out their conversation.
“…Outside….clean….snow..” I could only catch a few words. What is snow? I don’t remember Momma ever talking about snow. I was so distracted thinking of what snow could be that I was almost knocked over when Daddy came charging back into the room. 
“Baby girl!” He grinned as he picked me up and spun us around. “I have wonderful news!”
“After lunch.” Momma interrupted after following Daddy out of the room, “I want you to rerun the tests, and we are going to need our strength if we are going to do this.”
“Ah, you are such a worrywart, Katie. I have run the tests a dozen times already.”
Momma glared at Daddy over the rim of her glasses. Her brown eyes firm. “Aleister, rerun the tests. We need to be safe.”
Daddy ruffled my hair as he set me back down. “Ok, ok, Katie. I will.” With that, Daddy ducked back into the other room.
“Momma?” I looked up at her, “What tests is Daddy going to run? And what is snow?”
She just gave me a small smile. “You just may be able to find that out today. Now go clean your hands for lunch.”
I dragged Clunk with me over to the sink. Why wouldn’t Momma answer me? What is going on?
Momma went to set our small table, the plates clattering together as she carried them over. She had a faraway look on her face, and she was chewing on her bottom lip. After I cleaned up, I joined her at the table. “Will you tell me what snow is now?” I gave her my very best pouty face.
She ignored my pouted lips and dished me out some of the brown slop that was for lunch. I hated the brown goop. We had it for every meal, and it tasted like feet and smelled even worse. Daddy got this stuff from where he worked before the air turned to poison. He said that they are called MREs. I just call them gross.
I pushed the slop around my plate and watched the door to the other room. What tests could Daddy be running in there?
“Eat your lunch, Peach.” Momma lectured me. But I could see her stealing glances at the door too.
I wrinkled my nose and forced down a bite. I wish we could eat the food that was in my books. It all looked so good compared to this smelly stuff. Oranges, green beans, or all the other different colored foods all looked like they would be delicious. 
I had almost cleaned my plate of the slop when Daddy finally came back into the room and handed Momma some papers. “See? All clean. Like the last dozen tests.”
Momma’s hand was shaking when she took the papers from him, I looked up at her, and her eyes were filling with tears. “We can see the sun again, Aleister.” Her voice was small and broke in the middle of her words.
Daddy’s smile creased the sides of his eyes. He didn’t say anything more. He just reached out and grabbed Momma’s hand.
After a long moment passed, I couldn’t take it anymore. “What is going on?” My eyes darted between my parents, hoping for some answers. 
They exchanged another look, and Momma wiped her eyes. “We are going to the surface, Peach.” Daddy finally answered me. 
The surface? “But what about the poison?”
“It’s fading away. It is now safe for us to come out of this bunker.”
My heart started beating faster at the thought. I am going to get to see the surface! The sun. The trees and maybe even some bunnies! I clutched Clunk closer in excitement. “Let’s go!” I jumped to my bare feet. Daddy looked down at my feet and laughed.
“Shoes!” He exclaimed, darting over to our tiny closet, “You are going to need shoes. What do you think, Katie? Will a pair of yours work?”
Momma hesitated then nodded. “Just for a short trip, they should.”
Then Momma and Daddy were a dizzying twirl of movement. They were darting from one end of our house to the other, grabbing different things. Every few seconds, one of my parents would pause and put a new piece of clothing on me. I was soon covered in what felt like everything I owned.
“Momma, I’m hot.” I tried to take off some of the offending clothes, but Daddy stopped me.
“Now, Peach, it is cold on the surface right now, so you are going to need these layers.” He grinned down at me. “Are you ready?”
My excitement banished discomfort from my mind, and I nodded over and over. I stopped and looked around. “How do we get to the surface, Daddy?”
Daddy grabbed my hand and led me to the other room, the one I wasn’t supposed to enter. When he opened the door, I could see that it was a tiny room, on the far side was a ladder that reached up into the ceiling. Other than that, the only thing in the room was a small desk with a computer and some more sciencey stuff on it.
“You are going to need to leave Clunk down here,” Momma told me when she followed us into the room. “You need two hands to climb the ladder.”
I didn’t want to leave Clunk down here, but it would probably be safer for him. I set him on the chair by the desk and patted him on his head. “Be good, Clunk!”
Daddy climbed up the ladder and starting struggling with something at the top. He was grunting, and I heard him mutter a bad word. A few minutes passed, and then something clanged from the top. White flakes floated down from the opening. I tried to catch them, but they disappeared as soon as I touched them.
“Come on up.” Daddy called, “Everything is ok.” I stood there for a moment, frozen. I was about to go to the surface. This bunker has been all I’ve ever known for all my ten years. Terror was anchoring my feet to the floor. The touch of Momma’s hand on my shoulder calmed me down.
“It’s ok, my sweet Peach. Go ahead.” She whispered to me.
Momma’s encouragement made me reach out and grab the ladder. I carefully climbed it with Momma close behind me. Daddy helped me off the ladder when I reached the top.
Everything was so bright. It hurt my eyes to look around. I had to blink a few time to clear my vision. The surface is unlike anything I thought it would look like. Everything was white! There was no green anywhere. There were trees all over the place, but they were all brown. Momma must have seen the disappointment on my face.
“This is winter, Peach. That’s why there are no green things for you to see.” Momma explained when suddenly, something white hit Momma on the shoulder. Daddy was grinning at her and had another ball of the white stuff in his hand.
“Aleister!” Momma laughed, “Snowballs already?”
Snowballs? I looked at the white stuff covering the ground. I reached out and touched it. 
“That’s cold!” I could feel my eyes widen with wonder. “Is this…snow?”
Momma nodded, “It is frozen water.” Before she could explain more, Daddy threw another snowball at her. She let out a shriek and then started to pick up her own snowballs and to throw them back at him. I grabbed my own handful of snow to join in the fun. The next few minutes passed with plenty of laughter.
Daddy was rearing back to throw another snowball at me when he froze, his eyes focused somewhere behind me.
“Peach, look!” He pointed toward the big group of trees.
I turned and looked, “I don’t see anything.” There was just more white snow.
“Look closer!” He had a giant smile on his face.
I squinted at where he was pointing, and then I saw it. Right at the base of the tree. A Rabbit. A real-life rabbit. It was chewing some grass, and at my loud gasp, it hopped away into the forest.",The Snow Rabbit
,Kids,"Wu, short for Wuzhou, and his parents moved to Norway from China when he was only six years old. His parents named him “Five Continents” because they wanted him to travel the world. They envisioned him to be an explorer, a conqueror, and a citizen of the world.
Even though Wu’s father's name was Aiguo, he did not consider himself patriotic. He felt no affinity towards China and swore to move anywhere in the world just to provide the best future for his family. That’s why, when the opportunity arose, Ai packed up his family into three small suitcases and moved onto a different continent. He might have left friends and a few worldly possessions behind, but he was never the person to look back. It was his family’s future that was at stake. After all, his son and his wife meant everything to him.
Lan has always been like an orchid – delicate and beautiful. Even though her family wasn’t convinced that Aiguo was the best match for her initially, they came around once Wuzhou entered the world. It was then that they saw how driven their son-in-law was to better his family’s lives. Lan was just happy to walk through life with her best friend.
The Suns moved to Oslo, Norway, from Lingshui, China, in search of a more prosperous future. Lan’s uncle was a traveling professor, and he helped Ai get a job at one of the universities in Oslo. Since Wu was still relatively young, Lan agreed to stay at home and manage house tasks.
Only a couple of weeks after the move, Wu was playing with his toy trucks when he caught a glimpse of something unusual happening outside. It almost seemed like it was raining. But the rain did not look anything like what Wu had come to expect. He left his toys on the floor, stood up, and walked to his bedroom window. White flakes were falling from the sky and slowly covering the ground. Unable to explain that weird phenomenon to himself, he ran into the living room where his parents were watching TV. He wanted to make sure that the white flakes weren't only isolated to outside of his bedroom window. Wu walked up to the vast window by the TV and glued his nose to the glass.
“
” – Ai asked his son, getting up from the couch and walking towards the window.
“
” – Wu asked, puzzled, trying to dig through his memory to see if he could find a reference.
“
” – he asked after a moment of silence, unable to recall in what sense he heard the word snow used before.
“
” – his father explained.
Wu nodded in acknowledgment but was still nowhere near knowing what snow really was. He had a hard time figuring out why it was the first time in his life that he saw this magical snow and why his parents weren’t obsessed with it as he was.
“
” – Ai explained, realizing that none of his words meant too much sense to his little boy.
“
” – Lan
suggested.
Wu’s eyes lit up like a Christmas tree.
“
” – Ai said excitedly.
Even though Wu did not know what a snowman really was, and he definitely did not know how to build one, he could not wait to go outside and touch the snow. The snowflakes seemed tiny, yet the outside world was quickly disappearing under a blanket of the white dust. Wu agreed to go back to his room to play until lunch while his parents went back to watching TV, but the toys didn’t hold his interest. Instead, he sat by the window, imagining what he would do once he went outside. Lunch could not come soon enough.
“
” – Lan announced at precisely 1 pm.
Usually, Wu would take his sweet time finishing up playing with his toys, but this time he was in the kitchen before Lan even managed to plate the oven pancake with lingonberry jam.
“
” – his mother scolded him and pulled the fork out of his hand.
“
” – Aiguo announced, entering the kitchen.
“
” – his wife replied, slightly pointing her head in the direction of the kitchen window.
“
” – Ai acknowledged the obvious.
He and his wife promised Wu to go outside and play in the snow after lunch. Their son was doing everything in his power to speed up the process and to be able to run out.
“
” – the father announced.
Wu roughly cut his pancake and tried to fit multiple pieces into his mouth at a time.
“
” – the mother said, concerned.
She looked at her husband, and they both smiled. Wu’s excitement was infectious. Even though they themselves have seen snow in the past, they could not help but think back to their first snow encounter. Once lunch was finished, the Suns placed the dirty dishes in the sink and got ready to leave the house. 
The little boy was ready to go as he was, but his parents made sure he put on his brand-new snow pants, a jacket, a scarf, gloves, a hat, and snow boots.
“
” – Wu asked his mother as she handed him each item.
To him, all this was doing was delaying his fun in the snow. Although he had no idea what he would do yet, he knew it was going to be entertaining.
“
” – Lan replied and zipped up her son’s jacket.
When Ai opened the door, Wu rushed forward but stopped before crossing the threshold between the house and the outside. He looked down at the fresh layer of snow covering the cement steps.
“
” – Lan
said encouragingly.
Wu extended his leg forward and brought it almost to the ground but then paused, afraid of what the snow might do to the sole of his boot.
“
” – Ai chimed in.
Not wanting to appear scared, Wu placed his right foot on the snow. Nothing happened. Encouraged by that, he set his left foot firmly next to his right. Then, he made a few more steps forward and turned around. His bootprints appeared before him, and he nearly cried. He disrupted the uniform layer of snow that was covering the steps. To him, it felt like he just did the worst thing possible. To his shock, his parents came outside and paid no attention to the bootprints they left all over the place. Wu watched cautiously, but his mom and dad acted as if nothing happened.
“
” – Ai asked his son.
“
” – Wu wondered to himself but stuck out his tongue as instructed.
He could feel the drops of cold on his tongue, but he could not taste anything.
“
” – he thought to himself.
“
” – his mom recommended.
He complied and fixed his eyes on his navy blue glove.
“
!” – Wu wanted to shout.
“
” – his mother asked, pointing to individual snowflakes on his glove.
Wu, usually very talkative only nodded. A million thoughts swirled in his mind. He was not sure what to do with all this new information.
“
” – Aiguo proposed a plan.
At first, Wu wasn’t sure what a snowball was but quickly figured it out by observing his parents, who were rolling balls of snow.
Once all three balls were of similar size, Ai stacked them up one on top of the other. Lan
then pulled out a carrot and a couple of pieces of coal out of her pocket and placed them on the snowman. Ai gave the snowman his magician hat from Halloween, and his wife inserted a broom into the snowman to serve as an arm.
A smile crept onto Wu’s face. The snowman was made of snow, yet he had eyes, a nose, mouth, a coat, a hat, and an arm, just like people do.
“
” – his mother interrupted his thinking.
A part of him was curious to see how they were going to make an angel out of snow, but a part of him felt board. One snow creation was enough for him. His jaw almost dropped to the ground when he witnessed his parents bought laying down on the ground. They never let him do that!
“
” – his father said.
Wu was not sure if this was a test or not, but he decided to obey.
“
” – his mom said, extending her arms towards him.
Wu stood up and, prompted by his mother, looked at the ground where he had just laid.
“
” – he exclaimed, seeing his creation.
His parents laughed in unison.
“
” – Lan announced, rubbing her hands against one another.
As the Suns approached the door, Wu noticed that their previously left bootprints were almost entirely gone. The steps looked immaculate again, and he could not be happier. He now knew that he could never destroy something as magnificent as snow.",White fluffy powder
,Kids,"It was perhaps as well that the Internet was still in its infancy when Barbara Bellingham was born. Her mother Harriet, sitting sipping over-priced insipid coffee as she crouched over a clunky, chunky computer in an Internet café while she had trusted Barbara to the child’s grandmother’s care for a couple of hours, could not find out very much about her daughter’s condition. She had insisted that the doctor wrote it down, but still struggled to pronounce it. She discovered very little she did not already know. It was exceedingly rare, and could not be cured, but could be “managed”, and sometimes, if a child never exactly grew out of it, it could, if they were lucky, abate to a degree that meant they could live a relatively normal life. But that was not a given.
     Harriet had heard about children (and adults, come to that) who were hypersensitive to sunlight, and indeed to light itself, and who could only venture out after dark wearing thick opaque clothing and dark sunglasses. That was pretty rare, but what her daughter had was rarer. Harriet did not want her daughter to be a rarity. She wanted her to be a normal, ordinary, happy child, who would build snowmen and slide on the ice, and wear mittens her grandma had knitted for her.
     Before she was a year old she had almost died of what was not pneumonia, but gave a good impression of it. She survived, and some of Harriet’s friends said that she was a little fighter. Harriet had too much on her mind to pick a quarrel, but she wanted to scream that in the first place, a child who was too young to walk or talk had no concept of what was meant by a fight, and that in the second place, she did not want her to have to fight. 
     The hospital called in a specialist, and he called in another specialist, and they almost seemed reluctant to come to their conclusion, not just because they didn’t want it to be so, but because a thousand doctors could pass a thousand lifetimes and never encounter a child with Barbara’s affliction, and they were afraid of looking foolish.
     Despite the long words and complicated explanations, it was, in essence, an extreme allergy to the cold. “Could it be genetic?” Harriet asked. “My Mum is troubled by Raynaud’s syndrome.”
     “No, we don’t think it’s genetic,” the second specialist said, “And I must warn you that this is not something that can be handled with two pairs of socks or gloves and one of those little hand-warmers. Barbara was lucky this time. But it was touch and go. We can’t guarantee she would be lucky again. She must never even be in a chilly room, let alone outside on a cool day. We will carry out regular checks but I don’t want to build up any hopes.”
     Sometimes it was hard to believe, and not just because of not wanting to believe it. Though Barbara was a little pale, she did not give the impression of being a frail or sickly child. She thrived, and both walked and talked early. While she did not know any different, she was happy enough. Harriet was a single mother, but she was close to her Uncle Ben, and Harriet was well aware that he was a better father figure, especially to a child who was (oh, how she both hated and clung to the euphemism) 
 than her biological father would ever have been. She had her grandma wound round her little finger, and sitting on her lap, seemed to learn to read more or less by osmosis. She was home-schooled of course. They simply couldn’t risk her being in a chilly classroom, or an inattentive teacher letting her out into the playground on a cold day. And anyway, it wouldn’t be fair for her to be surrounded by children doing and enjoying what she could not. As luck would have it, though the word “luck” had a hollow ring, Harriet was a trained teacher.
     At first they even tried to censor the books she was read to and she read, and the TV programmes she watched, but it was her grandma who said, “We can’t carry on like this. I’m not saying we should – shove winter down her throat so to speak, that would just be perverse and cruel. But we can’t pretend it doesn’t exist – and this business of drawing the curtains when we don’t need to has to stop, too. Let the poor child at least have some light!”
     There were some difficult and heartbreaking conversations. But Barbara, like many children who grow up with mainly adult company, was precocious and nobody’s fool, and as Harriet said, when she was eight, “She KNOWS she’s not like other children.”
     “It’s time to tell her the truth – at least some of it,” her grandma said.
     “I’m afraid you’re ill, Barbara,” Harriet said, quietly, keeping her voice calm and practical with a massive effort as she dug her nails into her palms. “You have – something called an allergy,” (okay, technically it wasn’t, but it would do for the time being and the doctor himself had not hesitated to use the expression). “You’re allergic to the cold weather, and that’s why we have to keep you inside unless it’s warm, and you don’t go to school.”
     “Will I ever get better?” Her voice, too, was calm and quiet on the surface, but it suddenly seemed very small, and the expression in her saucer-like brown eyes was frightened.
     “There is – a chance you will,” Harriet said, unclenching her hands and taking her daughter in her arms. “Progress is being made all the time, and sometimes people grow out of it.”
     “Why – why me, Mummy?” It was not a resentful, peevish 
, but was hurt, and puzzled – and yet with a touch of defiance.
     “We don’t know, sweetheart. Even the doctors don’t really know. You were just – terribly unlucky.”
     “But – I’m not the only person in the whole wide world with it?” Despite everything, Harriet had to smile. “No, you’re not, but it’s very rare.” She thought better of saying something like, “And of course you’re the most special girl in the world to us.” Even at that age, though she was a polite child, Barbara was no lover of platitudes.
     Months edged and coalesced, and years passed. But it sometimes seemed as if everything was standing still, was more frozen than the ice that Barbara might only ever see on a screen, in a book, or through a double-glazed window in a room that was too hot for the others in it. Her check-ups showed no deterioration, but no improvement either.
     Like so many of us, Harriet didn’t believe in horoscopes, or certainly not the kind that were printed in newspapers and magazines, but couldn’t always resist a peep. “Guess what it says for Scorpio,” she said, to her mother and daughter, “Events take an unexpected turn. Well, THAT covers a multitude of sins!”
     “Uncle Ben says they’re crap,” Barbara said.
     “Don’t say 
,” Harriet rebuked her. She had been determined not to spoil Barbara or let her get away with things because of her condition – oh, that horrible weasel word “condition”.
     “Well, he does!”
     “And I daresay he’s right, but you can still mind your language!” As Ben’s favourite term of disparagement referred to bovine excrement, she supposed she’d got off lightly. 
     Yet it was Ben, of all people, who was to prove the horoscope right. He told Harriet he wanted a “private chat”. “Private chat” was by way of being code for a discussion that involved Barbara without her being present, though they told her a great deal.
     They met up in a local café, and Ben, after only the most perfunctory snort of derision at Harriet’s caramel cinnamon latte (he was a coffee purist) said, “Hear me out, while you digest that disgusting mixture. I know you have this qualification in Teaching English as a Foreign Language,” If she hadn’t had a mouthful of caffeine-infused foam she might have pointed out that now, technically, it was called Teaching English as a Second Language. “Well, Pat at work,” (he worked for a pharmaceuticals firm) “has connections with our Brazilian branch – and amazing work they do, too. Some folk reckon treatments for heaven knows what could be found in the Amazon if we only looked in the right places, and before they’ve chopped and burnt it all down!”
     Hurriedly swallowing her coffee, Harriet exclaimed, “Have they found something …..?”
     He clasped her hands. “I’m sorry, sis. I might have built up false hope there, and it’s unforgiveable. Not yet, so far as I know. But this still could be good news. There’s an adult education centre there, and they’re after someone to teach English – oh, not the scientific stuff,” he smiled, thoughtfully, “It’s weird, really, they can probably have a talk about advanced research more fluently than WE could, but the ordinary conversation is the problem. And let’s be frank, some of the spouses – and no, I DON’T only mean the wives, by any means! – would be glad of some project to interest them, too. So I at least mentioned you. Thank about it, Hatty! Don’t just dismiss it out of hand – a near equatorial climate, no winters ……”
     “No winters,” she repeated, dreamily, at first. Then she shook her head, “It’s tempting, but it seems – irresponsible. I’ve never been the impulsive one in the family.”
     He didn’t say anything, but she could tell he was thinking – as she was – that though she had, perhaps, always been the slightly more careful of the two, at one point she HAD been impulsive. “And even if I were,” she met him halfway, “I can’t afford to be – not now – and as you know perfectly well, though we’re not rolling in it, the can’t afford to be isn’t primarily about money!”
     “I’ll – at least talk to the doctor about it,” she said, expecting that he would, at least figuratively, fling up his hands in horror. But Dr Max Amory, with whom she had now become good friends, knowing that he was devoted to Barbara, at most flung a figurative finger. “It – has possibilities,” he said. “Time was when a “change of climate” was a standard treatment for TB and the likes and yes, sometimes, it certainly HELPED, even if it didn’t cure. Of course this isn’t the same, but we ought to at least make a few more enquiries.” They discovered that they would be living in a modern apartment block with expert medical staff on hand, even if they weren’t necessarily specialists in Barbara’s condition, “But come to that, neither am I, not really,” he said, frankly, “though I’ve done my best. It’s so rare that I doubt there is anyone who specialises just in it. This would all have to be planned very carefully, but if you – and Barbara! – want to move over there for a while, then it’s with my blessing. “
     Barbara, who spent half the year barely even going outside her own front door, looked as if seeing an angelic vision would have been positively mundane in comparison. Harriet knew that her mother had serious misgivings, but she also said, “In your position I might do the same thing, given the chance.”
     As Max Amory had said, it needed to be planned very carefully. Undertaking a long journey with a sick child – perhaps especially one whose illness was largely unseen and insidious – was a complex matter. The extra vaccinations she needed were a worry in themselves – though her illness didn’t compromise the immune system as much as some did, it was not the most robust, and there was always the worry of a bad reaction. But two months later, they were on their way. There had never been any question of selling their house, and Ben and Harriet’s Grandma promised to look after it. Even as Ben drove them to the airport, Barbara said, “I’ll miss that house – but oh, how glad I am to be out of it!” Though she was, to their relief, no pious Pollyanna, she was a plucky and pragmatic child, but whilst that never led them to forget just how unnatural her life was, it would have been impossible – and doing Barbara no favours – to dwell on it all the time. But when she said things like that, it made Harriet think that even though she knew this was by no means risk-free, she was doing the right thing.
     The flight to Manaus seemed to last forever, but it was Harriet, and not Barbara, who slept the most. The cabin crew knew about her health issues, of course, and at first, understandably enough, some of them had said they could do without the responsibility, but she won them over, and when they finally landed, they all said she must keep in touch and let them know how she was doing.
     They settled in quickly. Harriet’s work was pleasant, and her students keen to learn, and it made her remember why she had once been so keen to be a teacher.  For the first time in her life, Barbara went to school. There was a small, international school attached to the research facilities, but the first language of instruction was Portuguese. Barbara was still at an age when she picked up languages easily, and soon outstripped her mother in linguistic skills. For the first time in her life she made friends her own age – and was part of a little trio with a local girl called Maria, and the daughter of a Dutch researcher there, called Anneka. As she witnessed them chattering away together, sometimes switching between 3 languages, Harriet became even surer that she had made the right decision.
     Of course it still wasn’t a “normal life” and defiantly asking “what IS normal?” didn’t change that. She had regular medical check-ups. She knew herself that she couldn’t join Maria and Anneka when they went for a trip to an ice rink but insisted they did. “I mean – don’t think I’m not jealous, because I am, even though I hope they have a lovely time,” she told Harriet. “But it’s not as if their not going would do me one bit of good, so I’m not going to be mean about it.”
     Eleven going on thirty, thought Harriet, though in some ways, and it gladdened her heart, Barbara was starting to behave more like a child living a normal life. She knew in that heart that they could not and would not stay there forever, but though she had always been leery of the cult of “mindfulness” she had always known the advantages of living for the day and the minute and not in the world of before and after and what if, and it had become her default way of coping.
     Things were on an even keel, she thought. At least for a while. For a little while. That was until the day that the sky clouded over and the temperature fell within seconds. “This happens, sometimes,” one of her pupils, Diego, told her, “One of those quirks,”
     “They didn’t tell me!” Harriet exclaimed, panicking, and genuinely not sure if she had been told, but had been lulled by words like “extremely rare” when she, of all people, should have known that “extremely rare” did not preclude something happening. Without saying another word, and ignoring the concerned calls of her pupils, she ran out, and towards the school. Even she was shivering, though some of it, she desperately told herself, was because she only had a thin top on, and because she had got unused to even lukewarm weather. 
     Barbara’s teachers knew what the situation was. Barbara herself knew what the situation was. So what the hell was she doing, twirling round in the playground, looking at each desultory snowflake drifting from the contradictory equatorial sky as if it were a miracle, letting the little breeze tug at her hair? “It’s okay when it’s here, Mummy, isn’t it?” she asked.
     “You know bloody well it isn’t!” All her rules about swearing in front of her flew out of her mind in her fear. “You’re eleven, not four!”
     And then, in an instant, her anger and her fear seemed to evaporate as quickly as the plucky, displaced snowflakes as they hit the schoolyard. She did not blame her daughter, nor her daughter’s teachers, nor herself, and only saw and heard and felt her very soul reach out to and be at one with an infinitely strong, infinitely vulnerable child on the brink of adulthood whom she loved more than life itself. She saw her breathe in the cool air and poke out her tongue to catch the sparse snowflakes, and the moment itself seemed to freeze in time.
     But time did not freeze, and fears did return. Though Barbara seemed well, Harriet did, after a space of time that was both a heartbeat and a lifetime, lead her back to their apartment, and put an electric blanket round her. She called Dr Alvarez, though she knew that all he could do was to tell her to keep an eye on her and contact him at once if anything “changed”.
     Barbara slept well that night, but Harriet did not. She felt her skin, fearing the slightest chill, she listened to her breathing, fearing the slightest wheeze or catch.
     Then, the next morning, while her mother still slept an exhausted sleep she had fought against, Barbara got up, stretched her limbs, and got on with the rest of her life. Outside, the sun was shining brightly once more. She was quite sorry, really.","""Events Take an Unexpected Turn"""
,Kids,"	Ohio. I regularly contemplate how anyone could find joy living in Ohio. It’s just so boring. We’ve been here less than a year, and I can confidently say it’s the most boring place on the planet. There’s never been a good thing to say about Ohio, and yet, this is where mother and father have decided to live. I fear they may be idiots.
	Most days start exactly the same way. I sit at my table, eat my cereal, and stare longingly at the backyard through the paned-glass sliding door. Our giant dog, Rufus, sleeps listlessly outside his little dog house surrounded by leafless trees and a high, dull-grey fence. Even he is bored. I wonder if, like me, he prays for something exciting to happen? Hopefully not. I’d hate for him to share in my disappointment that it’s just Ohio. All the time.
	So, it should be no shock to you when I say that today isn’t any different. To be totally forthcoming, I think the dread of the whole thing is really starting to weigh on me. I don’t even want to look outside. Instead, I sigh, prop my head up on my less dominant arm to space out, and play with my tiny oat rings. After an unknown amount of time, and a few rings finding their way out of the bowl, mother approaches from the esteemed island of the kitchen.
“Oh! All done, honey?”
	I don’t even bother responding, despite not appreciating the condescension. We both know she’s going to take it regardless of what I do, and I just don’t have the fight in me. Not today. At least with the bowl out of my way I have some space. I collapse my head down to the table into my now folded arms and try to block everything out. With my eyes closed I can finally try to get some peace.
	But I should know better. There’s never any rest in this wicked place. A loud commotion draws me awake and calls my attention to the sliding door. Rufus apparently wants in, and he is noticeably uncomfortable. My mother, who can’t even bother getting off the phone, moseys over to open the door. As soon as the door opens, I understand why Rufus is so upset because the coldest gust of air I’ve ever felt dances around the room. I can feel it in my core, and I hate every second of it. Just add it to the list.
	Later in the den I hear my mother say on the phone that a winter storm was coming through. I assume she was on with my father because she began to giggle discussing the fireplace with him. I didn’t want to hear the rest, so instead I start wondering about this storm. What could she mean? There have been a lot of storms in Ohio, but I have never heard the word ‘winter’ used to describe one before. A pessimistic approach seems appropriate. 
	Staring at the ceiling, contemplating the woes the future has in store, the tension of my furrowed brow begins to give me a headache. To put myself at ease I try to visualize places better than this, which isn’t too difficult. I drift off to sleep imagining that I am rolling down the street of West Palm Beach, feeling the warm kiss of the sun on my cheek. I can smell the salt of the ocean mix with the many delicious cuisines on the grills of the boardwalk restaurants. Aah, this is much better.
	I’m not certain of how I got there, but I wake in my bed the following morning. The disappointment of not waking up in Florida is likely to set the tone for the whole day. When I get down to the kitchen something seems strange. It kind of seems brighter, and I can hear Rufus’s nails clicking as he walks around on the hardwood floor. He’s inside? That’s odd. I wonder what’s going on.
	As I sit at my table with my cereal already poured it all becomes clear. Outside of the paned-glass door, where my boring, plain backyard once sat is instead something outside of my realm of understanding that rockets me out of my morning blues. Everything in the yard is covered in what appears to be a shiny, white, substance that is reflecting the rays of the sun and brightening the whole world. It appears as though small, crystal-like clumps of this same substance are falling from the sky like rain in tiny, little balls. But it isn’t rain. I don’t know what it is, but it’s.…..mesmerizing! 
	My heart is racing as I take it all in. Surprisingly, my parents seem not to notice it at all. They’re just sitting there drinking their coffee while sharing a newspaper. How?! I must call their attention to this strange, new environment. They need to witness this beauty of which I am sure we’ve never experienced anywhere before! I point out towards the backyard and shout.
“Grek grua goo gie!”
	Dammit! That’s always so embarrassing. More importantly, they’re never going to realize what’s going on out there! To feel so high, and then sink so low. I can’t help but begin to wail. I thrash my arms about and end up knocking my bowl from the table, which sends my dry cereal scattered all over the floor. Great. The tantrum gets the attention of my parents, which brings my mother to stoop down beside me to clean up the mess. 
“What’s the matter, honey?” she asks looking up at me. The warm, caring voice she uses when I’m feeling particularly down always makes me feel a little bit better, and my wail deescalates to a weep.
 “Huh?” she continues, rubbing her thumb across my cheek.
	With tears welling in my eyes I can’t help but gaze out at the mysterious beauty. What has happened? Are we even in Ohio anymore? Just the thought tickles me, but, it just couldn’t be possible. My room, the den, and the kitchen all remain the same. Even the backyard, now blanketed in this beautiful anomaly, has the same structure of the one I remember. We have to still be in Ohio. 
	There’s just so much swirling around my head. Up until this point I feel I have been too harsh toward my hometown, and I find myself looking forward to potential future surprises like this. More importantly, I’ve realized today that my parents are not the idiots I have believed them to be. As the enormous weight lifts from my shoulders, I close my eyes and feel the last of my tears trickle down my face. With a deep, quivering breath, I settle myself, open my eyes, smile down at my mother, and slowly raise my arm to point to the backyard again.
“Grek grua goo gie.” I say, calmly to my mother. 
	She clearly doesn’t understand, but her eyes follow my arm and apparently something clicks.
“Ah! You like the snow, huh honey?”
	Snow. Even the sound of the word somehow brings joy to my heart. In her kindest act to date my mother picks me up from my table and carries me to the sliding door. Up close the beauty is even more magical. It’s all-encompassing. Everywhere I look: snow. Its scope is mesmerizing. My mother begins to bounce me while we continue to gaze. It feels like we’ve been standing here for hours taking it all in. My sweet, loving, not-idiot parents must sense how life-changing this moment is becoming for me, for my father joins us at the door, and he and mother are smiling like I’ve never seen them smile.
“Snow,” my mother whispers, softly and lovingly.
“Snow,” she repeats.
“S…..sn…..snow.” I echo, proudly.",Snow
,Kids,"Two weeks before winter break, my gave the news that we are moving. Again. I asked her were are we moving to now. And she responded with ""America"". I was shocked. We were finally going to America for the first time!
	I asked her what state we are moving to. She said with a grin, ""Seattle, Washington."" I asked her if it was on the city proper and she said that we are living at the outskirts of Seattle. Then she told me to go pack my things because we are leaving in two weeks and we have a lot of moving to do.
									**********************
	Two weeks had past quickly then I expected. During that time, I was cleaning my room for the last time, seeing my friends for the last time, and helping my brothers and sister pack. Two days before moving, we shipped all of our things to Seattle and they are to arrive in three days.
	Right now, we are staying at my aunts' house while we wait until my parents are done talking to the conservationists here in the Bahamas.
	Before bed the next night of our last day here at the Bahamas, I told a fairy tale to my brothers and sister. It was about how it should feel to live in a cold place during winter and hot during summer. How it snowed all the time in Washington State and how it rained all spring. And how it was always looked like some put a gray blanket over the sky and on special days, the sun would penetrate the clouds.
	One of my brothers asked me if it was going to snow soon in Washington. I said that it might. And I didn't want to disappoint him, so I googled it up. It said that it was going to snow in four days time. Guess when we arrive, we are going to shovel the driveway for the first time.
										**********************
	The next morning, we drove to the airport at around dawn. It was a one hour drive to and fro and so I took the liberty to gaze out the window and see for the last time the beauty of the Bahamas. At dawn, the rain forest looked alien. So many shadows lined the trees, the ground looked so dark that it was hard to see what was hiding in there, looking at you.
										**********************
	We were thirty minutes from touching down. The windows where pulled down, so we couldn't see anything from here. Guess I have to wait to see how Washington State looks like.
We finally got out of the plane after four hours of flight. Me and my family were exhausted. We were one hour away from home. There were windows lined up and down the terminal, and I was too exhausted to look out the window. I was getting my suitcase when I noticed something white out the windows.
	I went to go see what it was and it was just a white pile of something wet on the ground and side walk. 
	Thirty minutes from our house, we were finally out of the city. I looked out the window to see white 
coming out of the sky. I asked my mom what it was. She said that it was snow falling from the sky.
	I was amazed on what I saw. I nudged my sister who was sitting next to me in the cab and pointed to the snow that was falling from the sky.
									**********************
We finally arrived at our house by noon. When the taxi finally pulled over, I got out as quickly as I could and looked into the gray sky. The small flakes fell into my heated face. Smiling, I dashed into the awaiting mounds of snow. ",My First Winter

,Kids,,In Our Language
,Kids,"The sky above Untergang Falls was veiled in a rich blanket of reds and purples. It was a brisk December morning, just like the one before, but this one felt different. Oskar Fredrikson pulled back the curtains of his son’s guest bedroom window, and stared up into the clouds. 
“Dårlig. Veldig dårlig…” He mumbled. 
“What’s bad Farfar?” His granddaughter, Sophia, climbed up onto his lap. 
“See those clouds over there? See the deep red? Bad. Very bad. Means evil is afoot. When I was a boy, my village in Norway was attacked by one of the last of the Scandinavian Vikings. The sky was bright red that day, just like now. My mother said it was red with our people’s blood. Red sky in Nordic folklore means døden kommer…death is coming”
Sophie winced and ran over to her mother, who had appeared in the door way. She clung to her leg, and dug her face into her extended belly. 
“Sophie please be careful, the baby is already restless this morning. What’s Grandpa Oskar been telling you now?” Sophie scrunched her face, and gave her mother a shrug. Lindsey shot her father in law a piercing gaze, and he directed his attention back to the window, casually ignoring her. She sighed, and ruffled Sophie’s hair. 
“Come on little one, breakfast time.” She hobbled slowly and carefully down the stairs, one foot at a time. After going through the pain of several miscarriages, Lindsey took no chances. She was part of a community of people called the “Downwinders”. These people lived in northern Nevada at the time of nuclear testing in the 80’s, and had a world of health problems from the fallout, including cervical cancer. Lindsey was among the lucky. They caught it in its early stages, following her pregnancy with Sophie. While they were able to save her cervix, children were unlikely following the chemo. This child would be a rainbow baby. She was already 8 months along, and was determined to keep it safe. 
 Lindsey’s father had left her his house when he passed, including the fallout shelter he had built, just in case the mushroom clouds came back. As much as she feared another blast, she felt safe here. This was her home, and she never would have moved her family here if she didn’t think it was the best possible place to ride out the impending war. Oh yes, there are whispers. Talk of a draft, talk of reopening the nuclear testing site that caused so much damage to so many people. But this time, they would be ready. The shelter had food and supplies enough for years. She just hoped they wouldn’t have to utilize them any time soon.
Lindsey reached the first floor, and waddled into the kitchen. She loaded the coffee pot, poured Sophie some cereal, and put Kris’ toast in the toaster. “I’ll be right back. I have to talk to daddy. Stay here please.” She called to Sophie. But her daughter was already entranced by cartoons. She knocked on the door of her husband’s study. The door opened a crack.
“Kris? Honey, can I talk to you please?”
A low grumble came from behind the door, and Lindsey pushed it open the rest of the way. 
“Little longer, please. I’m almost done.” He mumbled into his notebook. She watched as his pen tore furiously into the pages. Kris was a writer. Not of novels or poetry, but he journaled often, and liked to jot down ideas for stories, even though he rarely committed to them. He’d done this ever since he was a child, when a therapist recommended it as a coping mechanism following his move from Norway to America. It always seemed to calm him when he felt uneasy. Lindsey saw the hurricane brewing in his eyes and knew today was no exception. She gently placed her hands on his shoulders, and kissed his head. She hesitated to add to the tornado in his head. 
“Honey…I’m concerned about your father. This morning he was going on to Sophie about his certain doom nonsense again, and he scared her half to death. Now she’s going to be terrified to go outside every time the sky is red because of his….”
Kris’ head shot up and his wide eyes glared at her in panic. “The sky is red?”
“Good grief not you too!” She cried, throwing her hands up. He softened and took her hand.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart. Dad takes those old wives tales very seriously and honestly, it’s hard for me not to too. Plus I think you may be a little bias toward him after that…incident after Sophie was born.”
She glared at him. Oskar flew in when Sophie was close to her due date, just as he had for this baby. Per tradition, he believed the whole family should be there to welcome a baby. Though this time his stay would be permanent given his old age. He had walked in on her as she was staring at her post-pregnancy belly with condemnation. She had never been “fit”, but she had been loathing the extra baby weight as a likely permanent fixture, untucking her midsection from her sweatpants, and poking at her stomach with a deep sigh. She hadn’t noticed Oskar come up behind her until he grabbed her sides. 
“Good birthing hips!” He announced, trying to comfort her clearly soured expression. She jumped, yanking her t-shirt over her exposed belly, and pulling her sweat pants up. “Excellent for beautiful grandbabies. Skinny girls are the last to be wives in my village. Boney hips no good for baby.” She knew he was trying to compliment her, that he would never do anything to make her uncomfortable and Europeans were notorious for having zero personal space, but the comment stuck, and she had looked at her “good birthing hips” with distain ever since.  
“I am not bias. I just don’t think they are appropriate stories for a 4 year old.” She scoffed. 
Kristoff smiled and kissed her hand. “I will talk to him, and Soph. But for now, I’m starving!” He stood up with one of those famous dad groans, and pecked her cheek. 
“Coffee is brewing, toast is toasting, and eggs will be on in a jiffy.” She replied with a confident smile. 
He grinned mischievously back at her, titillated by her ability to read him so well. He pulled in her plump figure with one swoop, and kissed her neck. 
“Hey now!” She cooed, playfully protesting. “That’s how we got into this mess and why I haven’t been able to tie my shoes or have a cup of coffee for that past 8 months!” He smiled, and knelt down to kiss her belly. 
“I can’t wait to meet you, little one. I’ll teach you to play baseball, to fix up a car, to pick up girls to ride around with in that car…” Kris laughed, pinching Lindsey’s rear as he stood up. She glared at him and sarcastically replied “And what if it IS a girl?” “Hm…Same deal!” He retorted. “Now let’s get some breakfast.”
Kris helped his wife back into the kitchen, just as Grandpa Oskar was finishing another story to Sophie. 
“And that’s why you never get caught in the rain after midnight. Now finish your juice before the Nökken jumps out of it!” Oskar chuckled, and Sophie stared into her cup uneasily, before dumping it into the sink. Lindsey buttered toast for Kris and herself, and took the dirty cup from the sink to get her own, Nökken-free juice. 
“Sophie, stop shaking the table please.” Kris and Lindsey both eyed their fidgety munchkin across the table. 
“Daddy I am NOT shaking the table!” She protested. 
Lindsey brought her attention back to the juice, and the liquid was vibrating in the cup as she poured. 
“Kris…KRIS!” She held the cup up in a panic, and the color drained from his face. 
Oskar leapt up and peered out the curtains just in time to see the bomber jets approaching with their roaring engines shaking the house. Not now. Not so soon. Not when everything was going so perfectly. He wipes the fear from his face and turned back to his family. “Kristoff. It’s time. They are here. Døden kommer.” He said in a shaky voice. 
Kris stood up calmly. “Lindsey. We have to go. Sophie, go upstairs and get the bag under your bed, and toss down the one under ours for your mother please. Dad, help gather the supplies we packed from the baby shower and get your bag. I need to go out and secure the bunker.”
Lindsey stood carefully, holding on to the counter. “And I’ll…” 
Her husband sat her back down. “And you’ll stay right here in your seat, away from falling objects, protecting our baby.” She had never seem him so level. She wanted to close her eyes, and go back to eating breakfast like nothing was wrong. But this was happening, and she had to focus on the precious lives around her. Inside her. Kris raced for the door, and Sophie upstairs. The poor thing thought it was time for the baby to come. “Oh!” exclaimed Lindsey. She got up, making her way to the living room, much to Oskar’s protest. She staggered over to the couch, unstable with the quaking ground, like a drunk college student. But she was determined. Patting down a cushion, she pulled it off the couch and walked back to the kitchen, handing it to Oskar. 
“The cushion is for me to carry, in case I fall. But our family album is inside. Our photos, Kristoff’s green card, Sophie’s birth certificate…and our ultrasound photos. They’re all in there. Our life is in here.” She wept. 
“Understood.” Oskar nodded. He too, had gone soldier on her. She had just been thinking it was a good thing he and Kristoff had both been trained for survival before, when he came back in the house. 
“We’re ready. Dad, do you have the baby supplies?” Oskar handed him the bag, which was filled to the brim, Tetris style. Kris called up the stairs to his daughter. “Sophie, are you ready? Please come down.” A large brown duffle bag came tumbling down the stairs, followed by a pink bag, and their little girl. 
“Sorry daddy. I was deciding. Do you think baby would like to meet Mr.Floppsy, or Olaf first?” She held up a rabbit in one hand, and a stuffed snowman in the other. 
“Bring them both if you like, sweetheart. I’m sure he’ll love them.” Lindsey cooed, taking her daughter’s bag. Kristoff opened his mouth to protest, but she shot him a glare that made him back down. He then turned to his father. “Dad, where’s your bag? Why aren’t you packed?” 
“Don’t need all that junk Kristoff. Just my family, safe and sound.” Kris nodded. There wasn’t time to argue. They opened the door and filed outside. The sky was painted dark, with streaks of red bleeding through. Kris opened the door to the underground bunker, and took a deep breath of fresh air for what may be the last time, before descending. He took his wife’s hand, and helped her down the ladder. Oskar picked up Sophie and hugged her tightly, kissing her cheek. “Farfar loves you so very much liten en. Always remember that.” She hugged him back, saying she loves him too, before being handed off to her father. The girls stepped away from the ladder, so Oskar could climb down, and Kris extended his hand to help him.
“Kristoff.” He sighed. “This door. I’ve looked at it many times before on my last visit. It’s why I chose to move here when I found out there was a possibility of war. It latches only from the outside. Kristoff…I am staying behind. I have to latch the door. What you’ve built…this family. It’s worth so much more than the few years I have left. Please go. Please keep your family safe. You have grown into an incredible man and I am so proud of you.” He handed Kristoff the cushion. His son stared at him completely lost for words, tears streaming down his face. Oskar bent down and hugged his son as he did his granddaughter, and closed the door to the bunker, locking it tightly. 
The following are journal entries retrieved from the same bunker, found abandoned 50 years later. 
December 29th, 2019
The radio down here still works, on a single station, reporting from a “secured location”. The surface has been declared unsafe. Radioactive until further notice…whenever that is. Which bring me to the reason I’m writing. For anyone that might read this, my name is Kristoff Fredrikson. I am in a fallout shelter with my pregnant wife, Lindsey, and our daughter, Sophia, following an attack made by the Middle East. My father, Oskar Fredrikson, chose to sacrifice himself and stay behind, for which I am eternally grateful. It has now been a week since the bomber jets let their atomic bomb loose. We know now they were targeting the Nevada nuclear testing site. Aim with the intent not just to kill, but destroy. I am so grateful our family is still here…even if we might not see the sun for quite some time.

Lindsey went into labor today. Between the stress and limited resources, it’s no wonder it came early. Through a considerable amount of effort, quick thinking, and resourcefulness, at 7:32 this morning, she delivered a healthy, beautiful, 5 pound, 4 ounce, baby boy. Our baby New Year. After months of arguing for name, it was completely unanimous when we saw his little face. Happy Birthday, Oskar Fredrikson Jr.
April 16th, 2020
Typically, fallout from radiation disperses in 30 days following a nuclear bomb. That’s what Sally Ruther-whatever on the evening news report said. But we’ve been down here for 4 freaking months now, and the radiation levels are still too high to even think about coming out, let alone going home. It’s because they hit the reactors too. You know, the ones we were told we inactive for months now? Turns out the government was cooking something up under the radar. Surprise! We don’t even have a home to go back to. Miss “coming to you from a safe and secured location” made sure to remind us of that. “Government agents in protective gear analyzed the situation on the surface, and while they were only able to withstand the fallout for 15 short minutes, results are looking bleak. Anyone listening, we urge you to stay sheltered until….” I shut the shit off. “Until further notice. Until further notice.” Will we even LIVE to see “further notice”? The devil himself has taken over the entire state of Nevada, and “results are looking bleak.”
September 30th 2020
It’s dad’s birthday today. I wouldn’t feel right not writing about him. Every time I feel like I want to snap, I think about dad and the second chance he gave us. Far too busy with our bundle to write most days, I’m afraid. Kudos to the cave men, because this has been a nightmare. Oskar is using cloth diapers that have to be cleaned, which is a responsibility we divide. The water reserve is limited down here. A single person, or even two, might survive for years, but a whole family and a baby…well, I just count the time we do have. I would give anything for my wife’s home cooking right now. A juicy steak with baked potatoes. MREs have their place, but that place is in a dog’s dish, not my dinner plate. Especially incredibly old ones from when the bunker was stocked. But we make due. We always make due. Until further notice…
 
January 1st, 2021
Happy Birthday, my Oskar the grouch. You are so smart. When mama teaches your sister, I see in your face that you’re trying to follow, that you understand the words as your tiny mouth tries to form them. So full of life and promise. I am so sorry about the way your life has been so far. Your mother and I wanted so much for you. For both our babies. My Sophie girl… there is so much in this world you haven’t experienced. I’d give my all so you both could have it. I’m sorry. 
October 27th 2021
The unthinkable happened last month. A rat has been living among us. It’s got into all the food we’ve been eating, contaminated it with trace amounts of radiation. We have very little left. Lindsey and I have been cutting our rations. Some days when Sophie is hungry I know Lindsey skips meals entirely. I see her once ripe figure starting to fade away. Her cheeks have hallowed and her eyes sunk in. We can’t live like this much longer. We can’t live much longer…
December 25th 2021
“Safe from a secured location” announced today that they are no longer safe in their secured location. The radiation has not improved as they expected. Their ETA for a safe atmosphere is over fifty years. We are on our last weeks worth of rations. My wife is skin and bones. It’s killing me to see her look so lifeless… we talked last night. We won’t watch each other starve, nor the children. We are going to the surface. We won’t die down here like animals. We know our fate. Thank you, my leatherback friend, for all the years of solace. Until further notice -Kristoff Fredrikson
Mr. Fredrikson closed his journal and nodded to his wife. They gathered the children, wordlessly hugging them, and kissed each other through tears before ascending the ladder of the bunker. Kristoff pushed it open. The air burned, and the sun was black.
“Look Oskar! This is called snow! Your very first snow!” Sophie exclaimed. The family looked up, and snowflakes hit their faces, falling from the scattered clouds of a blood red sky. ","Red Skies, Until Further Notice"
